"Solar Flare Prediction Model with Three Machine-Learning Algorithms
  Using Ultraviolet Brightening and Vector Magnetogram","We developed a flare prediction model using machine learning, which is
optimized to predict the maximum class of flares occurring in the following 24
h. Machine learning is used to devise algorithms that can learn from and make
decisions on a huge amount of data. We used solar observation data during the
period 2010-2015, such as vector magnetogram, ultraviolet (UV) emission, and
soft X-ray emission taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite. We detected active regions
from the full-disk magnetogram, from which 60 features were extracted with
their time differentials, including magnetic neutral lines, the current
helicity, the UV brightening, and the flare history. After standardizing the
feature database, we fully shuffled and randomly separated it into two for
training and testing. To investigate which algorithm is best for flare
prediction, we compared three machine learning algorithms: the support vector
machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and extremely randomized trees
(ERT). The prediction score, the true skill statistic (TSS), was higher than
0.9 with a fully shuffled dataset, which is higher than that for human
forecasts. It was found that k-NN has the highest performance among the three
algorithms. The ranking of the feature importance showed that the previous
flare activity is most effective, followed by the length of magnetic neutral
lines, the unsigned magnetic flux, the area of UV brightening, and the time
differentials of features over 24 h, all of which are strongly correlated with
the flux emergence dynamics in an active region.",2016-11-06T15:09:50Z
"Inferring Maps of the Sun's Far-side Unsigned Magnetic Flux from
  Far-side Helioseismic Images using Machine Learning Techniques","Accurate modeling of the Sun's coronal magnetic field and solar wind
structures require inputs of the solar global magnetic field, including both
the near and far sides, but the Sun's far-side magnetic field cannot be
directly observed. However, the Sun's far-side active regions are routinely
monitored by helioseismic imaging methods, which only require continuous
near-side observations. It is therefore both feasible and useful to estimate
the far-side magnetic-flux maps using the far-side helioseismic images despite
their relatively low spatial resolution and large uncertainties. In this work,
we train two machine-learning models to achieve this goal. The first
machine-learning training pairs simultaneous SDO/HMI-observed magnetic-flux
maps and SDO/AIA-observed EUV 304$\r{A}$ images, and the resulting model can
convert 304$\r{A}$ images into magnetic-flux maps. This model is then applied
on the STEREO/EUVI-observed far-side 304$\r{A}$ images, available for about 4.3
years, for the far-side magnetic-flux maps. These EUV-converted magnetic-flux
maps are then paired with simultaneous far-side helioseismic images for a
second machine-learning training, and the resulting model can convert far-side
helioseismic images into magnetic-flux maps. These helioseismically derived
far-side magnetic-flux maps, despite their limitations in spatial resolution
and accuracy, can be routinely available on a daily basis, providing useful
magnetic information on the Sun's far side using only the near-side
observations.",2022-11-23T02:10:00Z
Inclination Angles for Be Stars Determined Using Machine Learning,"We test the viability of training machine learning algorithms with synthetic
H alpha line profiles to determine the inclination angles of Be stars (the
angle between the central B star's rotation axis and the observer's line of
sight) from a single observed medium-resolution, moderate S/N, spectrum. The
performance of three different machine learning algorithms were compared:
neural networks tasked with regression, neural networks tasked with
classification, and support vector regression. Of these three algorithms,
neural networks tasked with regression consistently outperformed the other
methods with a RMSE error of 7.6 degrees on an observational sample of 92
galactic Be stars with inclination angles known from direct H alpha profile
fitting, from the spectroscopic signature of gravitational darkening, and, in a
few cases, from interferometric observations that resolved the disk. The
trained neural networks enable a quick and useful determination of the
inclination angles of observed Be stars which can be used to search for
correlated spin axes in young open clusters or to extract an equatorial
rotation velocity from a measurement of v sin(i).",2023-10-27T19:23:55Z
"A Machine Learning Approach to Correcting Atmospheric Seeing in Solar
  Flare Observations","Current post-processing techniques for the correction of atmospheric seeing
in solar observations -- such as Speckle interferometry and Phase Diversity
methods -- have limitations when it comes to their reconstructive capabilities
of solar flare observations. This, combined with the sporadic nature of flares
meaning observers cannot wait until seeing conditions are optimal before taking
measurements, means that many ground-based solar flare observations are marred
with bad seeing. To combat this, we propose a method for dedicated flare seeing
correction based on training a deep neural network to learn to correct
artificial seeing from flare observations taken during good seeing conditions.
This model uses transfer learning, a novel technique in solar physics, to help
learn these corrections. Transfer learning is when another network already
trained on similar data is used to influence the learning of the new network.
Once trained, the model has been applied to two flare datasets: one from
AR12157 on 2014/09/06 and one from AR12673 on 2017/09/06. The results show good
corrections to images with bad seeing with a relative error assigned to the
estimate based on the performance of the model. Further discussion takes place
of improvements to the robustness of the error on these estimates.",2020-11-25T15:17:26Z
"Solar Flare Prediction Using SDO/HMI Vector Magnetic Field Data with a
  Machine-Learning Algorithm","We attempt to forecast M-and X-class solar flares using a machine-learning
algorithm, called Support Vector Machine (SVM), and four years of data from the
Solar Dynamics Observatory's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, the first
instrument to continuously map the full-disk photospheric vector magnetic field
from space. Most flare forecasting efforts described in the literature use
either line-of-sight magnetograms or a relatively small number of ground-based
vector magnetograms. This is the first time a large dataset of vector
magnetograms has been used to forecast solar flares. We build a catalog of
flaring and non-flaring active regions sampled from a database of 2,071 active
regions, comprised of 1.5 million active region patches of vector magnetic
field data, and characterize each active region by 25 parameters. We then train
and test the machine-learning algorithm and we estimate its performances using
forecast verification metrics with an emphasis on the True Skill Statistic
(TSS). We obtain relatively high TSS scores and overall predictive abilities.
We surmise that this is partly due to fine-tuning the SVM for this purpose and
also to an advantageous set of features that can only be calculated from vector
magnetic field data. We also apply a feature selection algorithm to determine
which of our 25 features are useful for discriminating between flaring and
non-flaring active regions and conclude that only a handful are needed for good
predictive abilities.",2014-11-05T21:00:03Z
"ODUSSEAS: A machine learning tool to derive effective temperature and
  metallicity for M dwarf stars","Aims. The derivation of spectroscopic parameters for M dwarf stars is very
important in the fields of stellar and exoplanet characterization. The goal of
this work is the creation of an automatic computational tool, able to derive
quickly and reliably the T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and [Fe/H] of M dwarfs by using
their optical spectra, that can be obtained by different spectrographs with
different resolutions.
  Methods. ODUSSEAS (Observing Dwarfs Using Stellar Spectroscopic
Energy-Absorption Shapes) is based on the measurement of the pseudo equivalent
widths for more than 4000 stellar absorption lines and on the use of the
machine learning Python package ""scikit-learn"" for predicting the stellar
parameters.
  Results. We show that our tool is able to derive parameters accurately and
with high precision, having precision errors of ~30 K for T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$
and ~0.04 dex for [Fe/H]. The results are consistent for spectra with
resolutions between 48000 and 115000 and SNR above 20.",2020-02-21T15:49:31Z
"Improvements on coronal hole detection in SDO/AIA images using
  supervised classification","We demonstrate the use of machine learning algorithms in combination with
segmentation techniques in order to distinguish coronal holes and filaments in
SDO/AIA EUV images of the Sun. Based on two coronal hole detection techniques
(intensity-based thresholding, SPoCA), we prepared data sets of manually
labeled coronal hole and filament channel regions present on the Sun during the
time range 2011 - 2013. By mapping the extracted regions from EUV observations
onto HMI line-of-sight magnetograms we also include their magnetic
characteristics. We computed shape measures from the segmented binary maps as
well as first order and second order texture statistics from the segmented
regions in the EUV images and magnetograms. These attributes were used for data
mining investigations to identify the most performant rule to differentiate
between coronal holes and filament channels. We applied several classifiers,
namely Support Vector Machine, Linear Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree,
and Random Forest and found that all classification rules achieve good results
in general, with linear SVM providing the best performances (with a true skill
statistic of ~0.90). Additional information from magnetic field data
systematically improves the performance across all four classifiers for the
SPoCA detection. Since the calculation is inexpensive in computing time, this
approach is well suited for applications on real-time data. This study
demonstrates how a machine learning approach may help improve upon an
unsupervised feature extraction method.",2015-06-22T14:29:02Z
"Solar Flare Prediction and Feature Selection using Light Gradient
  Boosting Machine Algorithm","Solar flares are among the most severe space weather phenomena, and they have
the capacity to generate radiation storms and radio disruptions on Earth. The
accurate prediction of solar flare events remains a significant challenge,
requiring continuous monitoring and identification of specific features that
can aid in forecasting this phenomenon, particularly for different classes of
solar flares. In this study, we aim to forecast C and M class solar flares
utilising a machine-learning algorithm, namely the Light Gradient Boosting
Machine. We have utilised a dataset spanning 9 years, obtained from the
Space-weather Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager Active Region Patches (SHARP),
with a temporal resolution of 1 hour. A total of 37 flare features were
considered in our analysis, comprising of 25 active region parameters and 12
flare history features. To address the issue of class imbalance in solar flare
data, we employed the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). We
used two labeling approaches in our study: a fixed 24-hour window label and a
varying window that considers the changing nature of solar activity. Then, the
developed machine learning algorithm was trained and tested using forecast
verification metrics, with an emphasis on evaluating the true skill statistic
(TSS). Furthermore, we implemented a feature selection algorithm to determine
the most significant features from the pool of 37 features that could
distinguish between flaring and non-flaring active regions. We found that
utilising a limited set of useful features resulted in improved prediction
performance. For the 24-hour prediction window, we achieved a TSS of 0.63
(0.69) and accuracy of 0.90 (0.97) for $\geq$C ($\geq$M) class solar flares.",2023-10-30T08:04:48Z
Identifying typical Mg II flare spectra using machine learning,"IRIS performs solar observations over a large range of atmospheric heights,
including the chromosphere where the majority of flare energy is dissipated.
The strong Mg II h&k spectral lines are capable of providing excellent
atmospheric diagnostics, but have not been fully utilized for flaring
atmospheres. We aim to investigate whether the physics of the chromosphere is
identical for all flare observations by analyzing if there are certain spectra
that occur in all flares. To achieve this, we automatically analyze hundreds of
thousands of Mg II h&k line profiles from a set of 33 flares, and use a machine
learning technique which we call supervised hierarchical k-means, to cluster
all profile shapes. We identify a single peaked Mg II profile, in contrast to
the double-peaked quiet Sun profiles, appearing in every flare. Additionally,
we find extremely broad profiles with characteristic blue shifted central
reversals appearing at the front of fast-moving flare ribbons. These profiles
occur during the impulsive phase of the flare, and we present results of their
temporal and spatial correlation with non-thermal hard X-ray signatures,
suggesting that flare-accelerated electrons play an important role in the
formation of these profiles. The ratio of the integrated Mg II h&k lines can
also serve as an opacity diagnostic, and we find higher opacities during each
flare maximum. Our study shows that machine learning is a powerful tool for
large scale statistical solar analyses.",2018-05-26T15:19:46Z
"Testing and Validating Two Morphological Flare Predictors by Logistic
  Regression Machine Learning","Whilst the most dynamic solar active regions (ARs) are known to flare
frequently, predicting the occurrence of individual flares and their magnitude,
is very much a developing field with strong potentials for machine learning
applications.
  The present work is based on a method which is developed to define numerical
measures of the mixed states of ARs with opposite polarities. The method yields
compelling evidence for the assumed connection between the level of mixed
states of a given AR and the level of the solar eruptive probability of this AR
by employing two morphological parameters: (i) the separation parameter
$S_{l-f}$ and (ii) the sum of the horizontal magnetic gradient $G_{S}$.
  In this work, we study the efficiency of $S_{l-f}$ and $G_{S}$ as flare
predictors on a representative sample of ARs, based on the SOHO/MDI-Debrecen
Data (SDD) and the SDO/HMI - Debrecen Data (HMIDD) sunspot catalogues. In
particular, we investigate about 1000 ARs in order to test and validate the
joint prediction capabilities of the two morphological parameters by applying
the logistic regression machine learning method. Here, we confirm that the two
parameters with their threshold values are, when applied together, good
complementary predictors. Furthermore, the prediction probability of these
predictor parameters is given at least 70\% a day before.",2020-12-15T09:31:21Z
3D solar coronal loop reconstructions with machine learning,"The magnetic field plays an essential role in the initiation and evolution of
different solar phenomena in the corona. The structure and evolution of the 3D
coronal magnetic field are still not very well known. A way to get the 3D
structure of the coronal magnetic field is by performing magnetic field
extrapolations from the photosphere to the corona. In previous work, it was
shown that by prescribing the 3D reconstructed loops' geometry, the magnetic
field extrapolation finds a solution with a better agreement between the
modeled field and the reconstructed loops. Also, it improves the quality of the
field extrapolation. Stereoscopy represents the classical method for performing
3D coronal loop reconstruction. It uses at least two view directions. When only
one vantage point of the coronal loops is available, other 3D reconstruction
methods must be applied. Within this work, we present a method for the 3D loop
reconstruction based on machine learning. Our purpose for developing this
method is to use as many observed coronal loops in space and time for the
modeling of the coronal magnetic field. Our results show that we can build
machine learning models that can retrieve 3D loops based only on their
projection information. In the end, the neural network model will be able to
use only 2D information of the coronal loops, identified, traced and extracted
from the EUV images, for the calculation of their 3D geometry.",2021-03-18T00:33:30Z
"Prediction of Solar Proton Events with Machine Learning: Comparison with
  Operational Forecasts and ""All-Clear"" Perspectives","Solar Energetic Particle events (SEPs) are among the most dangerous transient
phenomena of solar activity. As hazardous radiation, SEPs may affect the health
of astronauts in outer space and adversely impact current and future space
exploration. In this paper, we consider the problem of daily prediction of
Solar Proton Events (SPEs) based on the characteristics of the magnetic fields
in solar Active Regions (ARs), preceding soft X-ray and proton fluxes, and
statistics of solar radio bursts. The machine learning (ML) algorithm uses an
artificial neural network of custom architecture designed for whole-Sun input.
The predictions of the ML model are compared with the SWPC NOAA operational
forecasts of SPEs. Our preliminary results indicate that 1) for the AR-based
predictions, it is necessary to take into account ARs at the western limb and
on the far side of the Sun; 2) characteristics of the preceding proton flux
represent the most valuable input for prediction; 3) daily median
characteristics of ARs and the counts of type II, III, and IV radio bursts may
be excluded from the forecast without performance loss; and 4) ML-based
forecasts outperform SWPC NOAA forecasts in situations in which missing SPE
events is very undesirable. The introduced approach indicates the possibility
of developing robust ""all-clear"" SPE forecasts by employing machine learning
methods.",2021-07-08T15:41:23Z
"Youth analysis of near infrared spectra of young low-mass stars and
  brown dwarfs","We aim at building a method that efficiently identifies young low-mass stars
and brown dwarfs from low-resolution near-infrared spectra, by studying
gravity-sensitive features and their evolution with age. We built a dataset
composed of all publicly available ($\sim$2800) near-infrared spectra of dwarfs
with spectral types between M0 and L3. First, we investigate methods for the
derivation of the spectral type and extinction using comparison to spectral
templates, and various spectral indices. Then, we examine gravity-sensitive
spectral indices and apply machine learning methods, in order to efficiently
separate young ($\lesssim$10 Myr) objects from the field. Using a set of six
spectral indices for spectral typing, including two newly defined ones (TLI-J
and TLI-K), we are able to achieve a precision below 1 spectral subtype across
the entire spectral type range. We define a new gravity-sensitive spectral
index (TLI-g) that consistently separates young from field objects, showing a
performance superior to other indices from the literature. Even better
separation between the two classes can be achieved through machine learning
methods which use the entire NIR spectra as an input. Moreover, we show that
the H- and K-bands alone are enough for this purpose. Finally, we evaluate the
relative importance of different spectral regions for gravity classification as
returned by the machine learning models. We find that the H-band broad-band
shape is the most relevant feature, followed by the FeH absorption bands at 1.2
$\mu m$ and 1.24 $\mu m$ and the KI doublet at 1.24 $\mu m$.",2021-10-12T21:23:03Z
"Deep Learning Applied to the Asteroseismic Modeling of Stars with
  Coherent Oscillation Modes","We develop a novel method based on machine learning principles to achieve
optimal initiation of CPU-intensive computations for forward asteroseismic
modeling in a multi-D parameter space. A deep neural network is trained on a
precomputed asteroseismology grid containing about 62 million coherent
oscillation-mode frequencies derived from stellar evolution models. These
models are representative of the core-hydrogen burning stage of
intermediate-mass and high-mass stars. The evolution models constitute a 6D
parameter space and their predicted low-degree pressure- and gravity-mode
oscillations are scanned, using a genetic algorithm. A software pipeline is
created to find the best fitting stellar parameters for a given set of observed
oscillation frequencies. The proposed method finds the optimal regions in the
6D parameters space in less than a minute, hence providing the optimal starting
point for further and more detailed forward asteroseismic modeling in a
high-dimensional context. We test and apply the method to seven pulsating stars
that were previously modeled asteroseismically by classical grid-based forward
modeling based on a $\chi^2$ statistic and obtain good agreement with past
results. Our deep learning methodology opens up the application of
asteroseismic modeling in +6D parameter space for thousands of stars pulsating
in coherent modes with long lifetimes observed by the $Kepler$ space telescope
and to be discovered with the TESS and PLATO space missions, while applications
so far were done star-by-star for only a handful of cases. Our method is open
source and can be used by anyone freely.",2018-11-08T19:01:03Z
"Evaluation of nearby young moving groups based on unsupervised machine
  learning","Nearby young stellar moving groups have been identified by many research
groups with different methods and criteria giving rise to cautions on the
reality of some groups. We aim to utilise moving groups in an unbiased way to
create a list of unambiguously recognisable moving groups and their members.
For the analysis, two unsupervised machine learning algorithms (K-means and
Agglomerative Clustering) are applied to previously known bona fide members of
nine moving groups from our previous study. As a result of this study, we
recovered six previously known groups (AB Doradus, Argus, $\beta$-Pic, Carina,
TWA, and Volans-Carina). Three the other known groups are recognised as well;
however, they are combined into two new separate groups (ThOr+Columba and
TucHor+Columba).",2019-08-16T10:23:09Z
"On the use of machine learning algorithms in the measurement of stellar
  magnetic fields","Regression methods based in Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA) have become an
important tool for data analysis in many different disciplines.
  In this work, we use MLA in an astrophysical context; our goal is to measure
the mean longitudinal magnetic field in stars (H_ eff) from polarized spectra
of high resolution, through the inversion of the so-called multi-line profiles.
  Using synthetic data, we tested the performance of our technique considering
different noise levels: In an ideal scenario of noise-free multi-line profiles,
the inversion results are excellent; however, the accuracy of the inversions
diminish considerably when noise is taken into account. In consequence, we
propose a data pre-process in order to reduce the noise impact, which consists
in a denoising profile process combined with an iterative inversion
methodology.
  Applying this data pre-process, we have found a considerable improvement of
the inversions results, allowing to estimate the errors associated to the
measurements of stellar magnetic fields at different noise levels.
  We have successfully applied our data analysis technique to two different
stars, attaining by first time the measurement of H_eff from multi-line
profiles beyond the condition of line autosimilarity assumed by other
techniques.",2018-07-27T17:08:09Z
"Accurately constraining velocity information from spectral imaging
  observations using machine learning techniques","Determining accurate plasma Doppler (line-of-sight) velocities from
spectroscopic measurements is a challenging endeavour, especially when weak
chromospheric absorption lines are often rapidly evolving and, hence, contain
multiple spectral components in their constituent line profiles. Here, we
present a novel method that employs machine learning techniques to identify the
underlying components present within observed spectral lines, before
subsequently constraining the constituent profiles through single or multiple
Voigt fits. Our method allows active and quiescent components present in
spectra to be identified and isolated for subsequent study. Lastly, we employ a
Ca II 8542 {\AA} spectral imaging dataset as a proof-of-concept study to
benchmark the suitability of our code for extracting two-component atmospheric
profiles that are commonly present in sunspot chromospheres. Minimisation tests
are employed to validate the reliability of the results, achieving median
reduced $\chi^2$ values equal to 1.03 between the observed and synthesised
umbral line profiles.",2020-07-15T18:00:01Z
"ROOSTER: a machine-learning analysis tool for Kepler stellar rotation
  periods","In order to understand stellar evolution, it is crucial to efficiently
determine stellar surface rotation periods. An efficient tool to automatically
determine reliable rotation periods is needed when dealing with large samples
of stellar photometric datasets. The objective of this work is to develop such
a tool. Random forest learning abilities are exploited to automate the
extraction of rotation periods in Kepler light curves. Rotation periods and
complementary parameters are obtained from three different methods: a wavelet
analysis, the autocorrelation function of the light curve, and the composite
spectrum. We train three different classifiers: one to detect if rotational
modulations are present in the light curve, one to flag close binary or
classical pulsators candidates that can bias our rotation period determination,
and finally one classifier to provide the final rotation period. We test our
machine learning pipeline on 23,431 stars of the Kepler K and M dwarf reference
rotation catalog of Santos et al. (2019) for which 60% of the stars have been
visually inspected. For the sample of 21,707 stars where all the input
parameters are provided to the algorithm, 94.2% of them are correctly
classified (as rotating or not). Among the stars that have a rotation period in
the reference catalog, the machine learning provides a period that agrees
within 10% of the reference value for 95.3% of the stars. Moreover, the yield
of correct rotation periods is raised to 99.5% after visually inspecting 25.2%
of the stars. Over the two main analysis steps, rotation classification and
period selection, the pipeline yields a global agreement with the reference
values of 92.1% and 96.9% before and after visual inspection. Random forest
classifiers are efficient tools to determine reliable rotation periods in large
samples of stars. [abridged]",2021-01-25T15:04:43Z
"Spectral feature extraction for DB white dwarfs through machine learning
  applied to new discoveries in the SDSS DR12 and DR14","Using a machine learning (ML) method, we mine DB white dwarfs (DBWDs) from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release (DR) 12 and DR14. The ML
method consists of two parts: feature extraction and classification. The least
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is used for the spectral
feature extraction by comparing high quality data of a positive sample group
with negative sample groups. In both the training and testing sets, the
positive sample group is composed of a selection of 300 known DBWDs, while the
negative sample groups are obtained from all types of SDSS spectra. In the
space of the LASSO detected features, a support vector machine is then employed
to build classifiers that are used to separate the DBWDs from the non DBWDs for
each individual type. Depending on the classifiers, the DBWD candidates are
selected from the entire SDSS dataset. After visual inspection, 2808 spectra
(2029 objects) are spectroscopically confirmed. By checking the samples with
the literature, there are 58 objects with 60 spectra that are newly identified,
including a newly discovered AM CVn. Finally, we measure their effective
temperatures (Teff), surface gravities (log g), and radial velocities, before
compiling them into a catalog.",2018-06-22T02:54:22Z
"Machine learning reveals systematic accumulation of electric current in
  lead-up to solar flares","Solar flares - bursts of high-energy radiation responsible for severe
space-weather effects - are a consequence of the occasional destabilization of
magnetic fields rooted in active regions (ARs). The complexity of AR evolution
is a barrier to a comprehensive understanding of flaring processes and accurate
prediction. Though machine learning (ML) has been used to improve flare
predictions, the potential for revealing precursors and associated physics has
been underexploited. Here, we train ML algorithms to classify between
vector-magnetic-field observations from flaring ARs, producing at least one
M-/X-class flare, and non-flaring ARs. Analysis of magnetic-field observations
accurately classified by the machine presents statistical evidence for (1) ARs
persisting in flare-productive states --- characterized by AR area --- for
days, before and after M- and X-class flare events, (2) systematic pre-flare
build-up of free energy in the form of electric currents, suggesting that
associated subsurface magnetic field is twisted, (3) intensification of Maxwell
stresses in the corona above newly emerging ARs, days before first flares.
These results provide new insights into flare physics and improving flare
forecasting.",2019-05-24T11:54:21Z
Analysing AIA Flare Observations using Convolutional Neural Networks,"In order to efficiently analyse the vast amount of data generated by solar
space missions and ground-base instruments, modern machine learning techniques
such as decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs) and neural networks can
be very useful. In this paper we present initial results from using a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyse observations from the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA) in the 1600A wavelength. The data is pre-processed to
locate flaring regions where flare ribbons are visible in the observations. The
CNN is created and trained to automatically analyse the shape and position of
the flare ribbons, by identifying whether each image belongs into one of four
classes: two-ribbon flare, compact/circular ribbon flare, limb flare or quiet
Sun, with the final class acting as a control for any data included in the
training or test sets where flaring regions are not present. The network
created can classify flare ribbon observations into any of the four classes
with a final accuracy of 94%. Initial results show that most of the images are
correctly classified with the compact flare class being the only class where
accuracy drops below 90% ad some observations are wrongly classified as
belonging to the limb class.",2020-05-27T11:34:41Z
"Forecasting Solar Flares Using Magnetogram-based Predictors and Machine
  Learning","We propose a forecasting approach for solar flares based on data from Solar
Cycle 24, taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission. In particular, we use the
Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) product that facilitates
cut-out magnetograms of solar active regions (AR) in the Sun in near-real-time
(NRT), taken over a five-year interval (2012 - 2016). Our approach utilizes a
set of thirteen predictors, which are not included in the SHARP metadata,
extracted from line-of-sight and vector photospheric magnetograms. We exploit
several Machine Learning (ML) and Conventional Statistics techniques to predict
flares of peak magnitude >M1 and >C1, within a 24 h forecast window. The ML
methods used are multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), support vector machines (SVM)
and random forests (RF). We conclude that random forests could be the
prediction technique of choice for our sample, with the second best method
being multi-layer perceptrons, subject to an entropy objective function. A
Monte Carlo simulation showed that the best performing method gives accuracy
ACC=0.93(0.00), true skill statistic TSS=0.74(0.02) and Heidke skill score
HSS=0.49(0.01) for >M1 flare prediction with probability threshold 15% and
ACC=0.84(0.00), TSS=0.60(0.01) and HSS=0.59(0.01) for >C1 flare prediction with
probability threshold 35%.",2018-01-17T16:45:18Z
"A New Tool for CME Arrival Time Prediction Using Machine Learning
  Algorithms: CAT-PUMA","Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are arguably the most violent eruptions in the
Solar System. CMEs can cause severe disturbances in the interplanetary space
and even affect human activities in many respects, causing damages to
infrastructure and losses of revenue. Fast and accurate prediction of CME
arrival time is then vital to minimize the disruption CMEs may cause when
interacting with geospace. In this paper, we propose a new approach for
partial-/full-halo CME Arrival Time Prediction Using Machine learning
Algorithms (CAT-PUMA). Via detailed analysis of the CME features and solar wind
parameters, we build a prediction engine taking advantage of 182 previously
observed geo-effective partial-/full-halo CMEs and using algorithms of the
Support Vector Machine (SVM). We demonstrate that CAT-PUMA is accurate and
fast. In particular, predictions after applying CAT-PUMA to a test set, that is
unknown to the engine, show a mean absolute prediction error $\sim$5.9 hours of
the CME arrival time, with 54% of the predictions having absolute errors less
than 5.9 hours. Comparison with other models reveals that CAT-PUMA has a more
accurate prediction for 77% of the events investigated; and can be carried out
very fast, i.e. within minutes after providing the necessary input parameters
of a CME. A practical guide containing the CAT-PUMA engine and the source code

"A Comparative Analysis of Machine-learning Models for Solar Flare
  Forecasting: Identifying High-performing Active Region Flare Indicators","Solar flares create adverse space weather impacting space and Earth-based
technologies. However, the difficulty of forecasting flares, and by extension
severe space weather, is accentuated by the lack of any unique flare trigger or
a single physical pathway. Studies indicate that multiple physical properties
contribute to active region flare potential, compounding the challenge. Recent
developments in machine learning (ML) have enabled analysis of
higher-dimensional data leading to increasingly better flare forecasting
techniques. However, consensus on high-performing flare predictors remains
elusive. In the most comprehensive study to date, we conduct a comparative
analysis of four popular ML techniques (k-nearest neighbor, logistic
regression, random forest classifier, and support vector machine) by training
these on magnetic parameters obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) for the entirety of solar
cycle 24. We demonstrate that the logistic regression and support vector
machine algorithms perform extremely well in forecasting active region flaring
potential. The logistic regression algorithm returns the highest true skill
score of $0.967 \pm 0.018$, possibly the highest classification performance
achieved with any strictly parametric study. From a comparative assessment, we
establish that the magnetic properties like total current helicity, total
vertical current density, total unsigned flux, R_VALUE, and total absolute
twist are the top-performing flare indicators. We also introduce and analyze
two new performance metrics, namely, severe and clear space weather indicators.
Our analysis constrains the most successful ML algorithms and identifies
physical parameters that contribute most to active region flare productivity.",2022-04-12T16:09:35Z
"Distinguishing between Flaring and Non-Flaring Active Regions: A Machine
  Learning Perspective","Large scale solar eruptions significantly impact space weather and damages
space-based human infrastructures. It is necessary to predict large scale solar
eruptions, which will enable us to protect our vulnerable infrastructures of
modern society. We aim to investigate the difference between flaring and
non-flaring active regions. We use photospheric vector magnetogram data from
Solar Dynamic Observatory's Helioseismic Magnetic Imager to study the time
evolution of photospheric magnetic parameters on the solar surface. We build a
database of flaring and non-flaring active region observed on the solar surface
from the years 2010 to 2017. We train the machine learning algorithm by the
time evolution of these active region parameters. Finally, we estimate the
performance obtained from this machine learning algorithm. We find the strength
of some magnetic parameters namely total unsigned magnetic flux, total unsigned
magnetic helicity, total unsigned vertical current and total photospheric
magnetic energy density in flaring active regions are much higher compared to
the non-flaring ones. These magnetic parameters in the flaring active region
are highly evolving and complex. We are able to obtain good forecasting
capability with a relatively high value of true skill statistic (TSS). We also
find that time evolution of total unsigned magnetic helicity and total unsigned
magnetic flux have very high ability to distinguish flaring and non-flaring
active regions. It is possible to distinguish flaring active region from the
non-flaring one with good accuracy. We confirm that there is no single common
parameter which can distinguish all flaring active regions from the non flaring
one. However, time evolution of top few magnetic parameters namely total
unsigned magnetic flux and total unsigned magnetic helicity have very high
distinguishing capability.",2020-03-09T01:02:48Z
"Solar activity classification based on Mg II spectra: towards
  classification on compressed data","Although large volumes of solar data are available for study, the vast
majority of these data remain unlabeled and are therefore not amenable to
supervised machine learning methods. Having a way to accurately and
automatically classify spectra into categories related to solar activity is
highly desirable and will assist and speed up future research efforts in solar
physics. At the same time, the large volume of raw observational data is a
serious bottleneck for machine learning, requiring powerful computational means
that are not at the disposal of many laboratories. Besides, the raw data
communication imposes restrictions on real time data observations and requires
considerable bandwidth and energy for the onboard solar observation systems. To
solve these issues, we propose a framework to classify solar activity on
compressed data. For this, we used a labeling scheme from a pre-existing vector
quantization technique in conjunction with different machine learning
algorithms to categorize spectra of singly-ionized magnesium Mg II measured by
NASA's Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph satellite (IRIS) into five types
of solar activity. Our training dataset is a human annotated list of 85 IRIS
observations containing 29097 frames. The annotated types of Solar activities
are active region, pre-flare activity, Solar flare, Sunspot, and quiet Sun. We
compress these data and reduce its complexity before training classifiers. We
found that the XGBoost classifier produces the most accurate results on the
compressed data, yielding over a 95\% prediction rate, and outperforming other
ML methods like convolution neural networks, K-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes
classifiers, and SVM. We find that the classification performance on compressed
and uncompressed data is comparable, implying the possibility of large
compression rates for relatively low degrees of information loss.",2020-09-15T15:07:53Z
Flare forecasting and feature ranking using SDO/HMI data,"We describe here the application of a machine learning method for flare
forecasting using vectors of properties extracted from images provided by the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager in the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI).
We also discuss how the method can be used to quantitatively assess the impact
of such properties on the prediction process.",2018-12-18T09:34:40Z
Identification of White Dwarf from Gaia EDR3 via Spectra from LAMOST DR7,"We cross-matched 1.3 million white dwarf (WD) candidates from Gaia EDR3 with
spectral data from LAMOST DR7 within 3 arcsec. Applying machine learning
described in our previous work, we spectroscopically identified 6,190 WD
objects after visual inspection, among which 1,496 targets were firstly
confirmed. 32 detailed classes were adopted for them, including but not limited
to DAB and DB+M. We estimated the atmospheric parameters for the DA and DB type
WD using Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares algorithm (LM). Finally, a catalog
of WD spectra from LAMOST was provided online.",2021-10-01T11:50:37Z
Detecting coronal mass ejections with machine learning methods,"Flares on the Sun are often associated with ejected plasma: these events are
known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs). These events, although are studied in
detail on the Sun, have only a few dozen known examples on other stars, mainly
detected using the Doppler-shifted absorption/emission features in Balmer lines
and tedious manual analysis. We present a possibility to find stellar CMEs with
the help of high-resolution solar spectra.",2024-01-15T10:47:53Z
"Increasing Lifetime of Recurrent Sunspot Groups within the Greenwich
  Photoheliographic Results","Long-lived (>20 days) sunspot groups extracted from the Greenwich Photo-
heliographic Results (GPR) are examined for evidence of decadal change. The
problem of identifying sunspot groups which are observed on consecutive solar
rotations (recurrent sunspot groups) is tackled by first constructing manually
an example dataset of recurrent sunspot groups and then using machine learning
to generalise this subset to the whole GPR. The resulting dataset of recurrent
sunspot groups is verified against previous work by A. Maunder and other Royal
Greenwich Observatory (RGO) compilers. Recurrent groups are found to exhibit a
slightly larger value for the Gnevyshev-Waldmeier Relationship than the value
found by Petrovay and van Driel-Gesztelyi (Solar Phys. 51, 25, 1997), who used
recurrence data from the Debrecen Photoheliographic Results. Evidence for
sunspot group lifetime change over the previous century is observed within
recurrent groups. A lifetime increase of 1.4 between 1915 and 1940 is found,
which closely agrees with results from Blanter et al. (Solar Phys. 237, 329,
2006). Furthermore, this increase is found to exist over a longer period (1915
to 1950) than previously thought and provisional evidence is found for a
decline between 1950 and 1965. Possible applications of machine-learning
procedures to the analysis of historical sunspot observations, the
determination of the magnetic topology of the solar corona and the incidence of
severe space-weather events are outlined briefly.",2009-07-24T12:47:20Z
"Oscillation frequencies for 35 \Kepler solar-type planet-hosting stars
  using Bayesian techniques and machine learning","\Kepler has revolutionised our understanding of both exoplanets and their
host stars. Asteroseismology is a valuable tool in the characterisation of
stars and \Kepler is an excellent observing facility to perform
asteroseismology. Here we select a sample of 35 \Kepler solar-type stars which
host transiting exoplanets (or planet candidates) with detected solar-like
oscillations. Using available \Kepler short cadence data up to Quarter 16 we
create power spectra optimised for asteroseismology of solar-type stars. We
identify modes of oscillation and estimate mode frequencies by ``peak bagging''
using a Bayesian MCMC framework. In addition, we expand the methodology of
quality assurance using a Bayesian unsupervised machine learning approach. We
report the measured frequencies of the modes of oscillation for all 35 stars
and frequency ratios commonly used in detailed asteroseismic modelling. Due to
the high correlations associated with frequency ratios we report the covariance
matrix of all frequencies measured and frequency ratios calculated. These
frequencies, frequency ratios, and covariance matrices can be used to obtain
tight constraint on the fundamental parameters of these planet-hosting stars.",2015-11-06T15:01:06Z
Predicting Coronal Mass Ejections Using Machine Learning Methods,"Of all the activity observed on the Sun, two of the most energetic events are
flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). Usually, solar active regions that
produce large flares will also produce a CME, but this is not always true
(Yashiro et al., 2005). Despite advances in numerical modeling, it is still
unclear which circumstances will produce a CME (Webb & Howard, 2012).
Therefore, it is worthwhile to empirically determine which features distinguish
flares associated with CMEs from flares that are not. At this time, no
extensive study has used physically meaningful features of active regions to
distinguish between these two populations. As such, we attempt to do so by
using features derived from [1] photospheric vector magnetic field data taken
by the Solar Dynamics Observatory's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager instrument
and [2] X-ray flux data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental
Satellite's X-ray Flux instrument. We build a catalog of active regions that
either produced both a flare and a CME (the positive class) or simply a flare
(the negative class). We then use machine-learning algorithms to [1] determine
which features distinguish these two populations, and [2] forecast whether an
active region that produces an M- or X-class flare will also produce a CME. We
compute the True Skill Statistic, a forecast verification metric, and find that
it is a relatively high value of approximately 0.8 plus or minus 0.2. We
conclude that a combination of six parameters, which are all intensive in
nature, will capture most of the relevant information contained in the
photospheric magnetic field.",2016-03-11T21:00:02Z
"Stellar Parameters in an Instant with Machine Learning: Application to
  Kepler LEGACY Targets","With the advent of dedicated photometric space missions, the ability to
rapidly process huge catalogues of stars has become paramount. Bellinger and
Angelou et al. (2016) recently introduced a new method based on machine
learning for inferring the stellar parameters of main-sequence stars exhibiting
solar-like oscillations. The method makes precise predictions that are
consistent with other methods, but with the advantages of being able to explore
many more parameters while costing practically no time. Here we apply the
method to 52 so-called ""LEGACY"" main-sequence stars observed by the Kepler
space mission. For each star, we present estimates and uncertainties of mass,
age, radius, luminosity, core hydrogen abundance, surface helium abundance,
surface gravity, initial helium abundance, and initial metallicity as well as
estimates of their evolutionary model parameters of mixing length, overshooting
coefficient, and diffusion multiplication factor. We obtain median
uncertainties in stellar age, mass, and radius of 14.8%, 3.6%, and 1.7%,
respectively.

"A machine learning approach for identification and classification of
  symbiotic stars using 2MASS and WISE","In this second paper in a series of papers based on the most-up-to-date
catalogue of symbiotic stars (SySts), we present a new approach for identifying
and distinguishing SySts from other Halpha emitters in photometric surveys
using machine learning algorithms such as classification tree, linear
discriminant analysis, and K-nearest neighbour. The motivation behind of this
work is to seek for possible colour indices in the regime of near- and
mid-infrared covered by the 2MASS and WISE surveys. A number of diagnostic
colour-colour diagrams are generated for all the known Galactic SySts and
several classes of stellar objects that mimic SySts such as planetary nebulae,
post-AGB, Mira, single K and M giants, cataclysmic variables, Be, AeBe, YSO,
weak and classical T Tauri stars, and Wolf-Rayet. The classification tree
algorithm unveils that primarily J-H, W1-W4 and Ks-W3 and secondarily H-W2,
W1-W2 and W3-W4 are ideal colour indices to identify SySts. Linear discriminant
analysis method is also applied to determine the linear combination of 2MASS
and AllWISE magnitudes that better distinguish SySts. The probability of a
source being a SySt is determined using the K-nearest neighbour method on the
LDA components. By applying our classification tree model to the list of
candidate SySts (Paper I), the IPHAS list of candidate SySts, and the DR2
VPHAS+ catalogue, we find 125 (72 new candidates) sources that pass our
criteria while we also recover 90 per cent of the known Galactic SySts.",2019-01-10T05:02:15Z
"Searching for Hot Subdwarf Stars in LAMOST DR1-II. Pure spectroscopic
  identification method for hot subdwarfs","Employing a new machine learning method, named hierarchical extreme learning
machine (HELM) algorithm, we identified 56 hot subdwarf stars in the first data
release (DR1) of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope
(LAMOST) survey. The atmospheric parameters of the stars are obtained by
fitting the profiles of hydrogen (H) Balmer lines and helium (He) lines with
synthetic spectra calculated from non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE)
model atmospheres. Five He-rich hot subdwarf stars were found in our sample
with their log(nHe/nH) > -1 , while 51 stars are He-poor sdB, sdO and sdOB
stars. We also confirmed the two He sequences of hot subdwarf stars found by
Edelmann et al. (2003) in Teff - log(nHe/nH) diagram. The HELM algorithm works
directly on the observed spectroscopy and is able to filter out spectral
properties without supplementary photometric data. The results presented in
this study demonstrate that the HELM algorithm is a reliable method to search
for hot subdwarf stars after a suitable training is performed, and it is also
suitable to search for other objects which have obvious features in their
spectra or images.",2019-06-29T02:29:38Z
"A New Automatic Tool for CME Detection and Tracking with Machine
  Learning Techniques","With the accumulation of big data of CME observations by coronagraphs,
automatic detection and tracking of CMEs has proven to be crucial. The
excellent performance of convolutional neural network in image classification,
object detection and other computer vision tasks motivates us to apply it to
CME detection and tracking as well. We have developed a new tool for CME
Automatic detection and tracking with MachinE Learning (CAMEL) techniques. The
system is a three-module pipeline. It is first a supervised image
classification problem. We solve it by training a neural network LeNet with
training labels obtained from an existing CME catalog. Those images containing
CME structures are flagged as CME images. Next, to identify the CME region in
each CME-flagged image, we use deep descriptor transforming to localize the
common object in an image set. A following step is to apply the graph cut
technique to finely tune the detected CME region. To track the CME in an image
sequence, the binary images with detected CME pixels are converted from
cartesian to polar coordinate. A CME event is labeled if it can move in at
least two frames and reach the edge of coronagraph field of view. For each
event, a few fundamental parameters are derived. The results of four
representative CMEs with various characteristics are presented and compared
with those from four existing automatic and manual catalogs. We find that CAMEL
can detect more complete and weaker structures, and has better performance to
catch a CME as early as possible.",2019-07-20T11:22:00Z
Neural Network Forecast of the Sunspot Butterfly Diagram,"Using neural networks as a prediction method, we attempt to demonstrate that
forecasting of the Sun's sunspot time series can be extended to the
spatial-temporal case. We employ this machine learning methodology to forecast
not only in time but also in space (in this case the latitude) on a
spatial-temporal dataset representing the solar sunspot diagram extending to a
total of 142 years. The analysis shows that this approach seems to be able to
reconstruct the overall qualitative aspects of the spatial-temporal series,
namely the overall shape and amplitude of the latitude and time pattern of
sunspots. This is, as far as we are aware, the first time neural networks have
been used to forecast the Sun's sunspot butterfly diagram, and although the
results are limited in the quantitative prediction aspects, it points the way
to use the full spatial-temporal series as opposed to just the time series for
machine learning approaches to forecasting. Further to that, we use the method
to predict that the upcoming Cycle 25 maximum sunspot number will be around
$R_{25}=57 \pm 17$. This implies a very weak cycle and that it will be the
weakest cycle on record.",2018-01-13T13:17:31Z
"The Deeper, Wider, Faster Program: Exploring stellar flare activity with
  deep, fast cadenced DECam imaging via machine learning","We present our 500 pc distance-limited study of stellar fares using the Dark
Energy Camera as part of the Deeper, Wider, Faster Program. The data was
collected via continuous 20-second cadence g band imaging and we identify
19,914 sources with precise distances from Gaia DR2 within twelve, ~3
square-degree, fields over a range of Galactic latitudes. An average of ~74
minutes is spent on each field per visit. All light curves were accessed
through a novel unsupervised machine learning technique designed for anomaly
detection. We identify 96 flare events occurring across 80 stars, the majority
of which are M dwarfs. Integrated are energies range from $\sim
10^{31}-10^{37}$ erg, with a proportional relationship existing between
increased are energy with increased distance from the Galactic plane,
representative of stellar age leading to declining yet more energetic are
events. In agreement with previous studies we observe an increase in flaring
fraction from M0 -> M6 spectral types. Furthermore, we find a decrease in the
flaring fraction of stars as vertical distance from the galactic plane is
increased, with a steep decline present around ~100 pc. We find that ~70% of
identified flares occur on short timescales of ~8 minutes. Finally we present
our associated are rates, finding a volumetric rate of $2.9 \pm 0.3 \times
10^{-6}$ flares pc$^{-3}$ hr$^{-1}$.",2021-06-23T01:08:43Z
"Applications of Machine-Learning Algorithms for Infrared Colour
  Selection of Galactic Wolf-Rayet Stars","We have investigated and applied machine-learning algorithms for Infrared
Colour Selection of Galactic Wolf-Rayet (WR) candidates. Objects taken from the
GLIMPSE catalogue of the infrared objects in the Galactic plane can be
classified into different stellar populations based on the colours inferred
from their broadband photometric magnitudes ($J$, $H$ and $K_s$ from 2MASS, and
the four \textit{Spitzer}/IRAC bands). The algorithms tested in this pilot
study are variants of the $k$-Nearest Neighbours ($k$-NN) approach, which is
ideal for exploratory studies of classification problems where interrelations
between variables and classes are complicated. The aims of this study are (1)
to provide an automated tool to select reliable WR candidates and potentially
other classes of objects, (2) to measure the efficiency of infrared colour
selection at performing these tasks and, (3) to lay the groundwork for
statistically inferring the total number of WR stars in our Galaxy. We report
the performance results obtained over a set of known objects and selected
candidates for which we have carried out follow-up spectroscopic observations,
and confirm the discovery of 4 new WR stars.",2017-12-04T23:19:53Z
"Discovery of 36 eclipsing EL CVn binaries found by the Palomar Transient
  Factory","We report the discovery and analysis of 36 new eclipsing EL CVn-type
binaries, consisting of a core helium-composition pre-white dwarf and an
early-type main-sequence companion, more than doubling the known population of
these systems. We have used supervised machine learning methods to search 0.8
million lightcurves from the Palomar Transient Factory, combined with SDSS,
Pan-STARRS and 2MASS colours. The new systems range in orbital periods from
0.46-3.8 d and in apparent brightness from ~14-16 mag in the PTF $R$ or
$g^{\prime}$ filters. For twelve of the systems, we obtained radial velocity
curves with the Intermediate Dispersion Spectrograph at the Isaac Newton
Telescope. We modelled the lightcurves, radial velocity curves and spectral
energy distributions to determine the system parameters. The radii (0.3-0.7
$\mathrm{R_{\odot}}$) and effective temperatures (8000-17000 K) of the
pre-He-WDs are consistent with stellar evolution models, but the masses
(0.12-0.28 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) show more variance than models predicted. This
study shows that using machine learning techniques on large synoptic survey
data is a powerful way to discover substantial samples of binary systems in
short-lived evolutionary stages.",2017-12-18T16:41:43Z
"Real-time flare prediction based on distinctions between flaring and
  non-flaring active region spectra","With machine learning entering into the awareness of the heliophysics
community, solar flare prediction has become a topic of increased interest.
Although machine learning models have advanced with each successive
publication, the input data has remained largely fixed on magnetic features.
Despite this increased model complexity, results seem to indicate that
photospheric magnetic field data alone may not be a wholly sufficient source of
data for flare prediction. For the first time we have extended the study of
flare prediction to spectral data. In this work, we use Deep Neural Networks to
monitor the changes of several features derived from the strong resonant Mg II
h\&k lines observed by IRIS. The features in descending order of predictive
capability are: The triplet emission at 2798.77 $\text{\AA}$, line core
intensity, total continuum emission between the h\&k line cores, the k/h ratio,
line-width, followed by several other line features such as asymmetry and line
center. Regions that are about to flare generate spectra which are
distinguishable from non-flaring active region spectra. Our algorithm can
correctly identify pre-flare spectra approximately 35 minutes before the start
of the flare, with an AUC of 86 \% and an accuracy, precision and recall of 80
\%. The accuracy and AUC monotonically increases to 90 \% and 97 \%
respectively as we move closer in time to the start of the flare. Our study
indicates that spectral data alone can lead to good predictive models and
should be considered as an additional source of information alongside
photospheric magnetograms.",2019-11-28T10:06:25Z
Identifying symbiotic stars with machine learning,"Symbiotic stars are interacting binary systems, making them valuable for
studying various astronomical phenomena, such as stellar evolution, mass
transfer, and accretion processes. Despite recent progress in the discovery of
symbiotic stars, a significant discrepancy between the observed population of
symbiotic stars and the number predicted by theoretical models. To bridge this
gap, this study utilized machine learning techniques to efficiently identify
new symbiotic stars candidates. Three algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, and
Decision Tree) were applied to a dataset of 198 confirmed symbiotic stars and
the resulting model was then used to analyze data from the LAMOST survey,
leading to the identification of 11,709 potential symbiotic stars candidates.
Out of the these potential symbiotic stars candidates listed in the catalog, 15
have spectra available in the SDSS survey. Among these 15 candidates, two
candidates, namely V* V603 Ori and V* GN Tau, have been confirmed as symbiotic
stars. The remaining 11 candidates have been classified as accreting-only
symbiotic star candidates. The other two candidates, one of which has been
identified as a galaxy by both SDSS and LAMOST surveys, and the other
identified as a quasar by SDSS survey and as a galaxy by LAMOST survey.",2023-07-16T09:53:48Z
"Using Machine Learning Methods to Forecast If Solar Flares Will Be
  Associated with CMEs and SEPs","Among the eruptive activity phenomena observed on the Sun, the most
technology threatening ones are flares with associated coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) and solar energetic particles (SEPs). Flares with associated CMEs and
SEPs are produced by magnetohydrodynamical processes in magnetically active
regions (ARs) on the Sun. However, these ARs do not only produce flares with
associated CMEs and SEPs, they also lead to flares and CMEs, which are not
associated with any other event. In an attempt to distinguish flares with
associated CMEs and SEPs from flares and CMEs, which are unassociated with any
other event, we investigate the performances of two machine learning
algorithms. To achieve this objective, we employ support vector machines (SVMs)
and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) using data from the Space Weather Database of
Notification, Knowledge, Information (DONKI) of NASA Space Weather Center, {\it
the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite} ({\it GOES}), and the
Space-Weather Heliospheric and Magnetic Imager Active Region Patches (SHARPs).
We show that True Skill Statistics (TSS) and Heidke Skill Scores (HSS)
calculated for SVMs are slightly better than those from the MLPs. We also show
that the forecasting time frame of 96 hours provides the best results in
predicting if a flare will be associated with CMEs and SEPs (TSS=0.92$\pm$0.09
and HSS=0.92$\pm$0.08). Additionally, we obtain the maximum TSS and HSS values
of 0.91$\pm$0.06 for predicting that a flare will not be associated with CMEs
and SEPs for the 36 hour forecast window, while the 108 hour forecast window
give the maximum TSS and HSS values for predicting CMEs will not be
accompanying any events (TSS=HSS=0.98$\pm$0.02).",2018-06-19T09:12:00Z
Forecasting Solar Cycle 25 using Deep Neural Networks,"With recent advances in the field of machine learning, the use of deep neural
networks for time series forecasting has become more prevalent. The
quasi-periodic nature of the solar cycle makes it a good candidate for applying
time series forecasting methods. We employ a combination of WaveNet and LSTM
neural networks to forecast the sunspot number using the years 1749 to 2019 and
total sunspot area using the years 1874 to 2019 time series data for the
upcoming Solar Cycle 25. Three other models involving the use of LSTMs and 1D
ConvNets are also compared with our best model. Our analysis shows that the
WaveNet and LSTM model is able to better capture the overall trend and learn
the inherent long and short term dependencies in time series data. Using this
method we forecast 11 years of monthly averaged data for Solar Cycle 25. Our
forecasts show that the upcoming Solar Cycle 25 will have a maximum sunspot
number around 106 $\pm$ 19.75 and maximum total sunspot area around 1771 $\pm$
381.17. This indicates that the cycle would be slightly weaker than Solar Cycle
24.",2020-05-25T21:06:52Z
"Determining surface rotation periods of solar-like stars observed by the
  Kepler mission using machine learning techniques","For a solar-like star, the surface rotation evolves with time, allowing in
principle to estimate the age of a star from its surface rotation period. Here
we are interested in measuring surface rotation periods of solar-like stars
observed by the NASA Kepler mission. Different methods have been developed to
track rotation signals in Kepler photometric light curves: time-frequency
analysis based on wavelet techniques, autocorrelation and composite spectrum.
We use the learning abilities of random forest classifiers to take decisions
during two crucial steps of the analysis. First, given some input parameters,
we discriminate the considered Kepler targets between rotating MS stars,
non-rotating MS stars, red giants, binaries and pulsators. We then use a second
classifier only on the MS rotating targets to decide the best data-analysis
treatment.",2019-06-23T17:03:36Z
"Machine-learning approach to identification of coronal holes in solar
  disk images and synoptic maps","Identification of solar coronal holes (CHs) provides information both for
operational space weather forecasting and long-term investigation of solar
activity. Source data for the first problem are typically most recent solar
disk observations, while for the second problem it is convenient to consider
solar synoptic maps. Motivated by the idea that the concept of CHs should be
similar for both cases we investigate universal models that can learn a CHs
segmentation in disk images and reproduce the same segmentation in synoptic
maps. We demonstrate that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained on daily
disk images provide an accurate CHs segmentation in synoptic maps and their
pole-centric projections. Using this approach we construct a catalog of
synoptic maps for the period of 2010-20 based on SDO/AIA observations in the
193 Angstrom wavelength. The obtained CHs synoptic maps are compared with
magnetic synoptic maps in the time-latitude and time-longitude diagrams. The
initial results demonstrate that while in some cases the CHs are associated
with magnetic flux transport events there are other mechanisms contributing to
the CHs formation and evolution. To stimulate further investigations the
catalog of synoptic maps is published in open access.",2020-06-15T16:37:20Z
"Identifying Solar Flare Precursors Using Time Series of SDO/HMI Images

inputs for machine learning algorithms. Two classification models are
presented: classification of flares from quiet times for active regions and
classification of strong versus weak flare events. We adopt deep learning
algorithms to capture both the spatial and temporal information from HMI
magnetogram data. Effective feature extraction and feature selection with raw
magnetogram data using deep learning and statistical algorithms enable us to
train classification models to achieve almost as good performance as using
active region parameters provided in HMI/Space-Weather HMI-Active Region Patch

score around 20 hours before strong solar flare events.",2019-03-30T00:30:06Z
"Prediction of Solar Flares Using Unique Signatures of Magnetic Field
  Images","Prediction of solar flares is an important task in solar physics. The
occurrence of solar flares is highly dependent on the structure and the
topology of solar magnetic fields. A new method for predicting large (M and X
class) flares is presented, which uses machine learning methods applied to the
Zernike moments of magnetograms observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) for a period of six
years from 2 June 2010 to 1 August 2016. Magnetic field images consisting of
the radial component of the magnetic field are converted to finite sets of
Zernike moments and fed to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Zernike
moments have the capability to elicit unique features from any 2-D image, which
may allow more accurate classification. The results indicate whether an
arbitrary active region has the potential to produce at least one large flare.
We show that the majority of large flares can be predicted within 48 hours
before their occurrence, with only 10 false negatives out of 385 flaring active
region magnetograms, and 21 false positives out of 179 non-flaring active
region magnetograms. Our method may provide a useful tool for prediction of
solar flares which can be employed alongside other forecasting methods.",2016-10-11T07:36:32Z
"Investigating Performance Trends of Simulated Real-time Solar Flare
  Predictions: The Impacts of Training Windows, Data Volumes, and the Solar
  Cycle","This study explores the behavior of machine learning-based flare forecasting
models deployed in a simulated operational environment. Using Georgia State
University's Space Weather Analytics for Solar Flares benchmark dataset (Angryk
et al. 2020a,b), we examine the impacts of training methodology and the solar
cycle on decision tree, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron
performance. We implement our classifiers using three temporal training
windows: stationary, rolling, and expanding. The stationary window trains
models using a single set of data available before the first forecasting
instance, which remains constant throughout the solar cycle. The rolling window
trains models using data from a constant time interval before the forecasting
instance, which moves with the solar cycle. Finally, the expanding window
trains models using all available data before the forecasting instance. For
each window, a number of input features (1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 120) and temporal
sizes (5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20 months) were tested. To our surprise, we found that
for a 20-month window, skill scores were comparable regardless of the window
type, feature count, and classifier selected. Furthermore, reducing the size of
this window only marginally decreased stationary and rolling window
performance. This implies that, given enough data, a stationary window can be
chosen over other window types, eliminating the need for model retraining.
Lastly, a moderately strong positive correlation was found to exist between a
model's false positive rate and the solar X-ray background flux. This suggests
that the solar cycle phase has a considerable influence on forecasting.",2024-02-07T22:04:06Z
Carbon stars identified from LAMOST DR4 using Machine Learning,"In this work, we present a catalog of 2651 carbon stars from the fourth Data
Release (DR4) of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopy Telescope
(LAMOST). Using an efficient machine-learning algorithm, we find out these
stars from more than seven million spectra. As a by-product, 17 carbon-enhanced
metal-poor (CEMP) turnoff star candidates are also reported in this paper, and
they are preliminarily identified by their atmospheric parameters. Except for
176 stars that could not be given spectral types, we classify the other 2475
carbon stars into five subtypes including 864 C-H, 226 C-R, 400 C-J, 266 C-N,
and 719 barium stars based on a series of spectral features. Furthermore, we
divide the C-J stars into three subtypes of CJ( H), C-J(R), C-J(N), and about
90% of them are cool N-type stars as expected from previous literature. Beside
spectroscopic classification, we also match these carbon stars to multiple
broadband photometries. Using ultraviolet photometry data, we find that 25
carbon stars have FUV detections and they are likely to be in binary systems
with compact white dwarf companions.",2017-12-21T03:51:19Z
"Sr and Ba abundance determinations: comparing machine-learning with
  star-by-star analyses -- High-resolution re-analysis of suspected LAMOST
  barium stars","A new large sample of 895 s-process-rich candidates out of 454180 giant stars
surveyed by LAMOST at low spectral resolution (R ~ 1800) has been reported by
Norfolk et al. (2019; hereafter N19). We aim at confirming the s-process
enrichment at the higher resolution (R ~ 86000) offered by the HERMES-Mercator
spectrograph, for the 15 brightest targets of the previous study sample which
consists in 13 Sr-only stars and two Ba-only stars. Abundances were derived for
elements Li, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Fe, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Ba, La, and Ce. Binarity
has been tested by comparing the Gaia DR2 radial velocity with the HERMES
velocity obtained 1600 - 1800 days later. Among the 15 programme stars, four
show no s-process overabundances ([X/Fe] < 0.2 dex), eight show mild s-process
overabundances (at least three heavy elements with 0.2 < [X/Fe] < 0.8), and
three have strong overabundances (at least three heavy elements with [X/Fe] >
0.8). Among the 13 stars classified as Sr-only by the previous investigation,
four have no s-process overabundances, eight are mild barium stars, and one is
a strong barium star. The two Ba-only stars turn out to be both strong barium
stars and are actually dwarf barium stars. They also show clear evidence for
being binaries. Among the no-s stars, there are two binaries out of four,
whereas only one out of the eight mild barium stars show a clear signature of
radial-velocity variations. Blending effects and saturated lines have to be
considered very carefully when using machine-learning techniques, especially on
low-resolution spectra. Among the Sr-only stars from the previous study sample,
one may expect about 60% (8/13) of them to be true mild barium stars and about
8% to be strong barium stars, and this fraction is likely close to 100% for the
previous study Ba-only stars (2/2).",2021-07-18T09:33:15Z
"Automatic detection of large-scale flux ropes and their geoeffectiveness
  with a machine learning approach","Detecting large-scale flux ropes (FRs) embedded in interplanetary coronal
mass ejections (ICMEs) and assessing their geoeffectiveness are essential since
they can drive severe space weather. At 1 au, these FRs have an average
duration of 1 day. Their most common magnetic features are large, smoothly
rotating magnetic fields. Their manual detection has become a relatively common
practice over decades, although visual detection can be time-consuming and
subject to observer bias. Our study proposes a pipeline that utilizes two
supervised binary-classification machine learning (ML) models trained with
solar wind magnetic properties to automatically detect large-scale FRs and
additionally determine their geoeffectiveness. The first model is used to
generate a list of auto-detected FRs. Using the properties of southward
magnetic field the second model determines the geoeffectiveness of FRs. Our
method identifies 88.6\% and 80\% large-scale ICMEs (duration $\ge 1$ day)
observed at 1 au by Wind and Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric
Investigation (STEREO) mission, respectively. While testing with a continuous
solar wind data obtained from Wind, our pipeline detected 56 of the 64
large-scale ICMEs during 2008 - 2014 period (recall= 0.875) but many false
positives (precision= 0.56) as we do not take into account any additional solar
wind properties than the magnetic properties. We found an accuracy of 0.88 when
estimating the geoeffectiveness of the auto-detected FRs using our method.
Thus, in space weather now-casting and forecasting at L1 or any planetary
missions, our pipeline can be utilized to offer a first-order detection of
large-scale FRs and geoeffectiveness.",2024-06-12T01:21:51Z
"Predicting solar flares with machine learning: investigating solar cycle
  dependence","A deep learning network, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, is used in
this work to predict whether the maximum flare class an active region (AR) will
produce in the next 24 hours is class $\Gamma$. We considered $\Gamma$ are $\ge
M$, $\ge C$ and any flare class. The essence of using LSTM, which is a
recurrent neural network, is its capability to capture temporal information of
the data samples. The input features are time sequences of 20 magnetic
parameters from SHARPs - Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches. We analyzed
active regions from June 2010 to Dec 2018, using the Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite (GOES) X-ray flare catalogs and label the data samples
with identified ARs in the GOES X-ray flare catalogs. Our results (i) shows
consistent skill scores with recently published results using LSTMs and better
than the previous work using single time input (eg. DeFN) (ii) The skill scores
from the model show essential differences when different years of data was
chosen for training and testing.",2019-12-01T21:37:02Z
"Short-term Classification of Strong Solar Energetic Particle Events
  using Multivariate Time Series Classifiers","Solar energetic particle (SEP) events are one of the most crucial aspects of
space weather that require continuous monitoring and forecasting. Their
prediction depends on various factors including source eruptions. In the
present work, we use the Geostationary Solar Energetic Particle (GSEP) data set
covering solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. We develop a framework using time
series-based machine learning (ML) models with the aim of developing robust
short-term forecasts by classifying SEP events. For this purpose, we introduce
an ensemble learning approach that merges the results from univariate time
series of three proton channels (10 MeV, 50 MeV, and 100 MeV) and the long band
X-ray flux channel from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite
(GOES) missions and analyze their performance. We consider three models,
namely, time series forest (TSF), supervised time series forest (STSF) and bag
of SFA symbols (BOSS). Our study also focuses on understanding and developing
confidence in the predictive capabilities of our models. Therefore, we utilize
multiple evaluation techniques and metrics. Based on that, we find STSF to
perform well in all scenarios. The summary of metrics for the STSF model is as
follows: AUC = 0.981; F1-score = 0.960; TSS = 0.919; HSS = 0.920; GSS = 0.852;
and MCC = 0.920. The Brier score loss of the STSF model is 0.077. This work
lays the foundation for building near-real-time (NRT) short-term SEP event
predictions using robust ML methods.",2024-03-26T06:16:11Z
A Deep Learning Approach to Operational Flare Forecasting,"Solar flares are explosions on the Sun. They happen when energy stored in
magnetic fields around solar active regions (ARs) is suddenly released. In this
paper, we present a transformer-based framework, named SolarFlareNet, for
predicting whether an AR would produce a gamma-class flare within the next 24
to 72 hours. We consider three gamma classes, namely the >=M5.0 class, the >=M
class and the >=C class, and build three transformers separately, each
corresponding to a gamma class. Each transformer is used to make predictions of
its corresponding gamma-class flares. The crux of our approach is to model data
samples in an AR as time series and to use transformers to capture the temporal
dynamics of the data samples. Each data sample consists of magnetic parameters
taken from Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) and related data
products. We survey flare events that occurred from May 2010 to December 2022
using the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite X-ray flare
catalogs provided by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI),
and build a database of flares with identified ARs in the NCEI flare catalogs.
This flare database is used to construct labels of the data samples suitable
for machine learning. We further extend the deterministic approach to a
calibration-based probabilistic forecasting method. The SolarFlareNet system is
fully operational and is capable of making near real-time predictions of solar
flares on the Web.",2024-05-25T06:17:47Z
"Magnetic Nonpotentiality in Photospheric Active Regions as a Predictor
  of Solar Flares","Based on several magnetic nonpotentiality parameters obtained from the vector
photospheric active region magnetograms obtained with the Solar Magnetic Field
Telescope at the Huairou Solar Observing Station over two solar cycles, a
machine learning model has been constructed to predict the occurrence of flares
in the corresponding active region within a certain time window. The Support
Vector Classifier, a widely used general classifier, is applied to build and
test the prediction models. Several classical verification measures are adopted
to assess the quality of the predictions. We investigate different flare levels
within various time windows, and thus it is possible to estimate the rough
classes and erupting times of flares for particular active regions. Several
combinations of predictors have been tested in the experiments. The True Skill
Statistics are higher than 0.36 in 97% of cases and the Heidke Skill Scores
range from 0.23 to 0.48. The predictors derived from longitudinal magnetic
fields do perform well, however they are less sensitive in predicting large
flares. Employing the nonpotentiality predictors from vector fields improves
the performance of predicting large flares of magnitude $\geq$M5.0 and
$\geq$X1.0.",2013-08-06T04:08:28Z
The Highly-Eccentric Detached Eclipsing Binaries in ACVS and MACC,"Next-generation synoptic photometric surveys will yield unprecedented (for
the astronomical community) volumes of data and the processes of discovery and
rare-object identification are, by necessity, becoming more autonomous. Such
autonomous searches can be used to find objects of interest applicable to a
wide range of outstanding problems in astronomy, and in this paper we present
the methods and results of a largely autonomous search for highly eccentric
detached eclipsing binary systems in the Machine-learned ASAS Classification
Catalog. 106 detached eclipsing binaries with eccentricities greater than 0.1
are presented, most of which are identified here for the first time. We also
present new radial-velocity curves and absolute parameters for 6 of those
systems with the long-term goal of increasing the number of highly eccentric
systems with orbital solutions, thereby facilitating further studies of the
tidal circularization process in binary stars.",2014-03-21T20:00:19Z
"Automated Detection Methods for Solar Activities and an Application for
  Statistic Analysis of Solar Filament","With the rapid development of telescopes, both temporal cadence and the
spatial resolution of observations are increasing. This in turn generates vast
amount of data, which can be efficiently searched only with automated
detections in order to derive the features of interest in the observations. A
number of automated detection methods and algorithms have been developed for
solar activities, based on the image processing and machine learning
techniques. In this paper, after briefly reviewing some automated detection
methods, we describe our efficient and versatile automated detection method for
solar filaments. It is able not only to recognize filaments, determine the
features such as the position, area, spine, and other relevant parameters, but
also to trace the daily evolution of the filaments. It is applied to process
the full disk H-alpha data observed in nearly three solar cycles, and some
statistic results are presented.",2018-04-10T03:00:36Z
Classification of Close Binary Stars Using Recurrence Networks,"Close binary stars are binary stars where the component stars are close
enough such that they can exchange mass and/or energy. They are subdivided into
semi-detached, overcontact or ellipsoidal binary stars. A challenging problem
in the context of close binary stars, is their classification into these
subclasses, based solely on their light curves. Conventionally, this is done by
observing subtle features in the light curves like the depths of adjacent
minima, which is tedious when dealing with large datasets. In this work we
suggest the use of machine learning algorithms applied to measures of
recurrence networks and nonlinear time series analysis to differentiate between
classes of close binary stars. We show that overcontact binary stars occupy a
region different from semi-detached and ellipsoidal binary stars in a plane of
characteristic path length(CPL) and average clustering coefficient(CC),
computed from their recurrence networks. We use standard clustering algorithms
and report that the clusters formed corresponds to the standard classes with a
high degree of accuracy.",2019-07-24T02:36:04Z
Solar Flare Intensity Prediction with Machine Learning Models,"We develop a mixed Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) regression model to predict
the maximum solar flare intensity within a 24-hour time window 0$\sim$24,
6$\sim$30, 12$\sim$36 and 24$\sim$48 hours ahead of time using 6, 12, 24 and 48
hours of data (predictors) for each Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
Active Region Patch (HARP). The model makes use of (1) the Space-weather HMI
Active Region Patch (SHARP) parameters as predictors and (2) the exact flare
intensities instead of class labels recorded in the Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellites (GOES) data set, which serves as the source of the
response variables. Compared to solar flare classification, the model offers us
more detailed information about the exact maximum flux level, i.e. intensity,
for each occurrence of a flare. We also consider classification models built on
top of the regression model and obtain better results in solar flare
classifications. Our results suggest that the most efficient time period for
predicting the solar activity is within 24 hours before the prediction time
using the SHARP parameters and the LSTM model.",2019-12-12T18:36:16Z
"A model-free, data-based forecast for sunspot cycle 25","The dynamic activity of the Sun, governed by its cycle of sunspots --
strongly magnetized regions that are observed on its surface -- modulate our
solar system space environment creating space weather. Severe space weather
leads to disruptions in satellite operations, telecommunications, electric
power grids and air-traffic on polar routes. Forecasting the cycle of sunspots,
however, has remained a challenging problem. We use reservoir computing -- a
model-free, neural--network based machine-learning technique -- to forecast the
upcoming solar cycle, sunspot cycle 25. The standard algorithm forecasts that
solar cycle 25 is going to last about ten years, the maxima is going to appear
in the year 2024 and the maximum number of sunspots is going to be 113
($\pm15$). We also develop a novel variation of the standard algorithm whose
forecasts for duration and peak timing matches that of the standard algorithm,
but whose peak amplitude forecast is 124 ($\pm2$) -- within the upper bound of
the standard reservoir computing algorithm. We conclude that sunspot cycle 25
is likely to be a weak, lower than average solar cycle, somewhat similar in
strength to sunspot cycle 24.",2020-05-25T15:27:31Z

FliPer: Classifying TESS pulsating stars,"The recently launched NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)
mission is going to collect lightcurves for a few hundred million of stars and
we expect to increase the number of pulsating stars to analyze compared to the
few thousand stars observed by the CoRoT, $\textit{Kepler}$ and K2 missions.
However, most of the TESS targets have not yet been properly classified and
characterized. In order to improve the analysis of the TESS data, it is crucial
to determine the type of stellar pulsations in a timely manner. We propose an
automatic method to classify stars attending to their pulsation properties, in
particular, to identify solar-like pulsators among all TESS targets. It relies
on the use of the global amount of power contained in the power spectrum
(already known as the FliPer method) as a key parameter, along with the
effective temperature, to feed into a machine learning classifier. Our study,
based on TESS simulated datasets, shows that we are able to classify pulsators
with a $98\%$ accuracy.",2018-11-29T13:49:28Z
"Generate Radioheliograph Image from SDO/AIA Data with Machine Learning
  Method","The radioheliograph image is essential for the study of solar short term
activities and long term variations, while the continuity and granularity of
radioheliograph data is not so ideal, due to the short visible time of the sun
and the complex electron-magnetic environment near the ground-based radio
telescope. In this work, we develop a multi-channel input single-channel output
neural network, which can generate radioheliograph image in microwave band from
the Extreme Ultra-violet (EUV) observation of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA) on-board the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). The neural network is
trained with nearly 8 years of data of Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) at 17
GHz and SDO/AIA from January 2011 to September 2018. The generated
radioheliograph image is in good consistency with the well-calibrated NoRH
observation. SDO/AIA provides solar atmosphere images in multiple EUV
wavelengths every 12 seconds from space, so the present model can fill the
vacancy of limited observation time of microwave radioheliograph, and support
further study of the relationship between the microwave and EUV emission.",2020-06-23T14:01:26Z
"Global Energetics of Solar Flares. XI. Flare Magnitude Predictions of
  the GOES-Class","In this study we determine scaling relationships of observed solar flares
that can be used to predict upper limits of the GOES-class magnitude of solar
flares. The flare prediction scheme is based on the scaling of the
slowly-varying potential energy $E_p(t)$, which is extrapolated in time over an
interval of $\Delta t \le$ 24 hrs. The observed scaling of the dissipated
energy $E_{diss}$ scales with the potential field energy as $E_{diss} \propto
E_p^{1.32}$. In addition, the observed scaling relationship of the flare
volume, $V \propto E_{diss}^{1.17}$, the multi-thermal energy, $E_{th} \propto
V^{0.76}$, the flare emission measure $EM \propto E_{th}^{0.79}$, the
EM-weighted temperature $T_{w}$, and the GOES flux, $F_8(t) \propto
E_p(t)^{0.92}$, allows us then to predict an upper limit of the GOES-class
flare magnitude in the extrapolated time window. We find a good correlation
(CCC$\approx 0.7$) between the observed and predicted GOES-class flare
magnitudes (in 172 X and M-class events). This is the first algorithm that
employs observed scaling laws of physical flare parameters to predict GOES flux
upper limits, an important capability that complements previous flare
prediction methods based on machine-learning algorithms used in space weather
forecasting.",2020-07-08T20:28:16Z
On the Impulsive Heating of Quiet Solar Corona,"The solar corona consists of a million-degree Kelvin plasma. A complete
understanding of this phenomenon demands the study of Quiet Sun (QS) regions.
In this work, we study QS regions in the 171 {\AA}, 193 {\AA} and 211 {\AA}
passbands of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO), by combining the empirical impulsive heating forward model
of Pauluhn & Solanki (2007) with a machine-learning inversion model that allows
uncertainty quantification. We find that there are {\approx} 2--3 impulsive
events per min, with a lifetime of about 10--20 min. Moreover, for all the
three passbands, the distribution of power law slope {\alpha} peaks above 2.
Our exploration of correlations among the frequency of impulsive events and
their timescales and peak energy suggests that conduction losses dominate over
radiative cooling losses. All these finding suggest that impulsive heating is a
viable heating mechanism in QS corona.",2021-03-31T05:52:34Z
"Identification of emission-line stars in transition phase from pre-main
  sequence to main sequence","Pre-main sequence (PMS) stars evolve into main sequence (MS) phase over a
period of time. Interestingly, we found a scarcity of studies in existing
literature that examines and attempts to better understand the stars in PMS to
MS transition phase. The purpose of the present study is to detect such rare
stars, which we named as 'Transition Phase' (TP) candidates - stars evolving
from the PMS to the MS phase. We identified 98 TP candidates using photometric
analysis of a sample of 2167 classical Be (CBe) and 225 Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe)
stars. This identification is done by analyzing the near- and mid-infrared
excess and their location in the optical color-magnitude diagram. The age and
mass of 58 of these TP candidates are determined to be between 0.1-5 Myr and
2-10.5 M$_\odot$, respectively. The TP candidates are found to possess
rotational velocity and color excess values in between CBe and HAeBe stars,
which is reconfirmed by generating a set of synthetic samples using the machine
learning approach.",2021-08-17T20:33:58Z
"Discovery of CWISE J052306.42-015355.4, an Extreme T Subdwarf Candidate","We present the discovery of CWISE J052306.42$-$015355.4, which was found as a
faint, significant proper motion object (0.52 $\pm$ 0.08 arcsec yr$^{-1}$)
using machine learning tools on the unWISE re-processing on time series images
from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. Using the CatWISE2020 W1 and W2
magnitudes along with a $J-$band detection from the VISTA Hemisphere Survey,
the location of CWISE J052306.42$-$015355.4 on the W1$-$W2 vs. $J-$W2 diagram
best matches that of other known, or suspected, extreme T subdwarfs. As there
is currently very little knowledge concerning extreme T subdwarfs we estimate a
rough distance of $\le$ 68 pc, which results in a tangential velocity of $\le$
167 km s$^{-1}$, both of which are tentative. A measured parallax is greatly
needed to test these values. We also estimate a metallicity of $-1.5 <$ [M/H]
$< -0.5$ using theoretical predictions.",2021-11-16T01:50:07Z
Two-dimensional Parameter Relationships for W UMa-type Systems Revisited,"Reviewing the empirical and theoretical parameter relationships between
various parameters is a good way to understand more about contact binary
systems. In this investigation, two-dimensional (2D) relationships for
P-M_V(system), P-L_1,2, M_1,2-L_1,2, and q-L_ratio were revisited. The sample
used is related to 118 contact binary systems with an orbital period shorter
than 0.6 days whose absolute parameters were estimated based on the Gaia Data
Release 3 (DR3) parallax. We reviewed previous studies on 2D relationships and
updated six parameter relationships. Therefore, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
and Machine Learning (ML) methods were used, and the outcomes were compared. We
selected 22 contact binary systems from eight previous studies for comparison,
which had light curve solutions using spectroscopic data. The results show that
the systems are in good agreement with the results of this study.",2023-10-29T18:52:26Z
Automatic detection of solar radio bursts in NenuFAR observations,"Solar radio bursts are some of the brightest emissions at radio frequencies
in the solar system. The emission mechanisms that generate these bursts offer a
remote insight into physical processes in solar coronal plasma, while fine
spectral features hint at its underlying turbulent nature. During radio noise
storms many hundreds of solar radio bursts can occur over the course of a few
hours. Identifying and classifying solar radio bursts is often done manually
although a number of automatic algorithms have been produced for this purpose.
The use of machine learning algorithms for image segmentation and
classification is well established and has shown promising results in the case
of identifying Type II and Type III solar radio bursts. Here we present the
results of a convolutional neural network applied to dynamic spectra of NenuFAR
solar observations. We highlight some initial success in segmenting radio
bursts from the background spectra and outline the steps necessary for burst
classification.",2024-01-09T10:13:41Z
The Early-type Stars from LAMOST survey: Atmospheric parameters,"Massive stars play key roles in many astrophysical processes. Deriving
atmospheric parameters of massive stars is important to understand their
physical properties and thus are key inputs to trace their evolution. Here we
report our work on adopting the data-driven technique Stellar LAbel Machine
({\tt SLAM}) with the non-LTE TLUSTY synthetic spectra as the training dataset
to estimate the stellar parameters of LAMOST optical spectra for early-type
stars. We apply two consistency tests to verify this machine learning method
and compare stellar labels given by {\tt SLAM} with that in literature for
several objects having high-resolution spectra. We provide the stellar labels
of effective temperature ($T_\mathrm{eff}$), surface gravity ($\log{g}$),
metallicity ([M/H]), and projected rotational velocity ($v\sin{i}$) for 3,931
and 578 early-type stars from LAMOST Low-Resolution Survey (LAMOST-LRS) and
Medium-Resolution Survey (LAMOST-MRS), respectively. To estimate the average
statistical uncertainties of our results, we calculated the standard deviation
between the predicted stellar label and the pre-labeled published values from
the high-resolution spectra. The uncertainties of the four parameters are
$\sigma(T_\mathrm{eff}) = 2,185 $K, $\sigma(\log{g}) = 0.29$ dex, and
$\sigma(v\sin{i}) = 11\, \rm km\,s^{-1}$ for MRS, and $\sigma(T_\mathrm{eff}) =
1,642 $K, $\sigma(\log{g}) = 0.25$ dex, and $\sigma(v\sin{i}) = 42\, \rm
km\,s^{-1}$ for LRS spectra, respectively. We notice that parameters of
$T_\mathrm{eff}$, $\log{g}$ and [M/H] can be better constrained using LRS
spectra rather than using MRS spectra, most likely due to their broad
wavelength coverage, while $v\sin{i}$ is constrained better by MRS spectra than
by LRS spectra, probably due to the relatively accurate line profiles of MRS
spectra.",2021-10-12T18:03:06Z
"Classification and parameterisation of a large Gaia sample of white
  dwarfs using XP spectra","The latest Gaia data release in July 2022, DR3, added a number of important
data products to those available in earlier releases, including radial velocity
data, information on stellar multiplicity and XP spectra of a selected sample
of stars. While the normal Gaia photometry (G, GBP and GRP bands) and
astrometry can be used to identify white dwarfs with high confidence, it is
much more difficult to parameterise the stars and determine the white dwarf
spectral type from this information alone. The availability of the XP spectra
and synthetic photometry presents an opportunity for more detailed spectral
classification and measurement of effective temperature and surface gravity of
Gaia white dwarfs. A magnitude limit of G < 17.6 was applied to the routine
production of XP spectra for Gaia sources, which would have excluded most white
dwarfs. We created a catalogue of 100,000 high-quality white dwarf
identifications for which XP spectra were processed, with a magnitude limit of
G < 20.5. Synthetic photometry was computed for all these stars, from the XP
spectra, in Johnson, SDSS and J-PAS, published as the Gaia Synthetic Photometry
Catalogue - White Dwarfs (GSPC-WD). We have now taken this catalogue and
applied machine learning techniques to provide a classification of all the
stars from the XP spectra. We have then applied an automated spectral fitting
programme, with chi-squared minimisation, to measure their physical parameters
(effective temperature and log g) from which we can estimate the white dwarf
masses and radii. We present the results of this work, demonstrating the power
of being able to classify and parameterise such a large sample of 100, 000
stars. We describe what we can learn about the white dwarf population from this
data set. We also explore the uncertainties in the process and the limitations
of the data set.",2023-08-10T13:34:47Z
"The VVV Templates Project. Towards an Automated Classification of VVV
  Light-Curves. I. Building a database of stellar variability in the
  near-infrared","Context. The Vista Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea (VVV) ESO Public Survey is
a variability survey of the Milky Way bulge and an adjacent section of the disk
carried out from 2010 on ESO Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for
Astronomy (VISTA). VVV will eventually deliver a deep near-IR atlas with
photometry and positions in five passbands (ZYJHK_S) and a catalogue of 1-10
million variable point sources - mostly unknown - which require
classifications. Aims. The main goal of the VVV Templates Project, that we
introduce in this work, is to develop and test the machine-learning algorithms
for the automated classification of the VVV light-curves. As VVV is the first
massive, multi-epoch survey of stellar variability in the near-infrared, the
template light-curves that are required for training the classification
algorithms are not available. In the first paper of the series we describe the
construction of this comprehensive database of infrared stellar variability.
Methods. First we performed a systematic search in the literature and public
data archives, second, we coordinated a worldwide observational campaign, and
third we exploited the VVV variability database itself on (optically)
well-known stars to gather high-quality infrared light-curves of several
hundreds of variable stars. Results. We have now collected a significant (and
still increasing) number of infrared template light-curves. This database will
be used as a training-set for the machine-learning algorithms that will
automatically classify the light-curves produced by VVV. The results of such an
automated classification will be covered in forthcoming papers of the series.",2014-05-18T15:08:10Z
"The Synthetic-Oversampling Method: Using Photometric Colors to Discover
  Extremely Metal-Poor Stars","Extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars ([Fe/H] < -3.0 dex) provide a unique window
into understanding the first generation of stars and early chemical enrichment
of the Universe. EMP stars are exceptionally rare, however, and the relatively
small number of confirmed discoveries limits our ability to exploit these
near-field probes of the first ~500 Myr after the Big Bang. Here, a new method
to photometrically estimate [Fe/H] from only broadband photometric colors is
presented. I show that the method, which utilizes machine-learning algorithms
and a training set of ~170,000 stars with spectroscopically measured [Fe/H],
produces a typical scatter of ~0.29 dex. This performance is similar to what is
achievable via low-resolution spectroscopy, and outperforms other photometric
techniques, while also being more general. I further show that a slight
alteration to the model, wherein synthetic EMP stars are added to the training
set, yields the robust identification of EMP candidates. In particular, this
synthetic-oversampling method recovers ~20% of the EMP stars in the training
set, at a precision of ~0.05. Furthermore, ~65% of the false positives from the
model are very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < -2.0 dex). The synthetic-oversampling
method is biased towards the discovery of warm (~F-type) stars, a consequence
of the targeting bias from the SDSS/SEGUE survey. This EMP selection method
represents a significant improvement over alternative broadband optical
selection techniques. The models are applied to >12 million stars, with an
expected yield of ~600 new EMP stars, which promises to open new avenues for
exploring the early universe.",2015-05-07T20:01:39Z
On The Statistical Properties of the Lower Main Sequence,"Astronomy is in an era where all-sky surveys are mapping the Galaxy. The
plethora of photometric, spectroscopic, asteroseismic and astrometric data
allows us to characterise the comprising stars in detail. Here we quantify to
what extent precise stellar observations reveal information about the
properties of a star, including properties that are unobserved, or even
unobservable. We analyse the diagnostic potential of classical and
asteroseismic observations for inferring stellar parameters such as age, mass
and radius from evolutionary tracks of solar-like oscillators on the lower main
sequence. We perform rank correlation tests in order to determine the capacity
of each observable quantity to probe structural components of stars and infer
their evolutionary histories. We also analyse the principal components of
classic and asteroseismic observables to highlight the degree of redundancy
present in the measured quantities and demonstrate the extent to which
information of the model parameters can be extracted. We perform multiple
regression using combinations of observable quantities in a grid of
evolutionary simulations and appraise the predictive utility of each
combination in determining the properties of stars. We identify the
combinations that are useful and provide limits to where each type of
observable quantity can reveal information about a star. We investigate the
accuracy with which targets in the upcoming TESS and PLATO missions can be
characterized. We demonstrate that the combination of observations from GAIA
and PLATO will allow us to tightly constrain stellar masses, ages and radii
with machine learning for the purposes of Galactic and planetary studies.",2017-03-29T18:00:01Z
"Predicting Solar Flares Using SDO/HMI Vector Magnetic Data Product and
  Random Forest Algorithm","Adverse space weather effects can often be traced to solar flares, prediction
of which has drawn significant research interests. The Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI) produces full-disk vector magnetograms with continuous
high cadence, while flare prediction efforts utilizing this unprecedented data
source are still limited. Here we report results of flare prediction using
physical parameters provided by the Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches
(SHARP) and related data products. We survey X-ray flares occurred from 2010
May to 2016 December, and categorize their source regions into four classes (B,
C, M, and X) according to the maximum GOES magnitude of flares they generated.
We then retrieve SHARP related parameters for each selected region at the
beginning of its flare date to build a database. Finally, we train a
machine-learning algorithm, called random forest (RF), to predict the
occurrence of a certain class of flares in a given active region within 24
hours, evaluate the classifier performance using the 10-fold cross validation
scheme, and characterize the results using standard performance metrics.
Compared to previous works, our experiments indicate that using the HMI
parameters and RF is a valid method for flare forecasting with fairly
reasonable prediction performance. To our knowledge, this is the first time
that RF is used to make multi-class predictions of solar flares. We also find
that the total unsigned quantities of vertical current, current helicity, and
flux near polarity inversion line are among the most important parameters for
classifying flaring regions into different classes.",2017-06-08T00:57:32Z
"A Data-driven Study of RR Lyrae Near-IR Light Curves: Principal
  Component Analysis, Robust Fits, and Metallicity Estimates","RR~Lyrae variables are widely used tracers of Galactic halo structure and
kinematics, but they can also serve to constrain the distribution of the old
stellar population in the Galactic bulge. With the aim of improving their
near-infrared photometric characterization, we investigate their near-infrared
light curves, as well as the empirical relationships between their light curve
and metallicities using machine learning methods. We introduce a new, robust
method for the estimation of the light-curve shapes, and hence the average
magnitudes of RR~Lyrae variables in the $K_\mathrm{S}$ band, by utilizing the
first few principal components (PCs) as basis vectors, obtained from the PC
analysis of a training set of light curves. Furthermore, we use the amplitudes
of these PCs to predict the light-curve shape of each star in the $J$-band,
allowing us to precisely determine their average magnitudes (hence colors),
even in cases where only one $J$ measurement is available. Finally, we
demonstrate that the $K_\mathrm{S}$-band light-curve parameters of RR~Lyrae
variables, together with the period, allow the estimation of the metallicity of
individual stars with an accuracy of $\sim 0.2 - 0.25$ dex, providing valuable
chemical information about old stellar populations bearing RR~Lyrae variables.
The methods presented here can be straightforwardly adopted for other classes
of variable stars, bands, or for the estimation of other physical quantities.",2018-04-04T15:11:02Z
"An Updated Catalog of 4680 Northern Eclipsing Binaries with Algol-Type
  light curve morphology in the Catalina Sky Surveys","We present an updated catalog of 4680 northern eclipsing binaries (EBs) with
Algol-type light curve morphology (i.e., with well-defined beginning and end of
primary and secondary eclipses), using data from the Catalina Sky Surveys. Our
work includes revised period determinations, phenomenological parameters of the
light curves, and system morphology classification based on machine learning
techniques. While most of the new periods are in excellent agreement with those
provided in the original Catalina catalogs, improved values are now available
for ~10% of the stars. A total of 3456 EBs were classified as detached and 449
as semi-detached, while 145 cannot be classified unambiguously into either
subtype. The majority of the SD systems seems to be comprised of short-period
Algols. By applying color criteria, we searched for K- and M-type dwarfs in
these data, and present a subsample of 609 EB candidates for further
investigation. We report 119 EBs (2.5% of the total sample) that show maximum
quadrature light variations over long timescales, with periods bracketing the
range 4.5-18 yrs and fractional luminosity variance of 0.04-0.13. We discuss
possible causes for this, making use of models of variable starspot activity in
our interpretation of the results.",2018-08-29T11:04:55Z
"Fundamental Parameters of $\sim$30,000 M dwarfs in LAMOST DR1 Using
  Data-driven Spectral Modeling","M dwarfs are the most common type of star in the Galaxy, and because of their
small size are favored targets for searches of Earth-sized transiting
exoplanets. Current and upcoming all-sky spectroscopic surveys, such as the
Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), offer an
opportunity to systematically determine physical properties of many more M
dwarfs than has been previously possible. Here we present new effective
temperatures, radii, masses, and luminosities for 29,678 M dwarfs with spectral
types M0-M6 in the first data release (DR1) of LAMOST. We derived these
parameters from the supervised machine learning code, The Cannon, trained with
1,388 M dwarfs in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Cool Dwarf
Catalog that were also present in LAMOST with high signal-to-noise ratio
($>$250) spectra. Our validation tests show that the output parameter
uncertainties are strongly correlated with the signal-to-noise of the LAMOST
spectra, and we achieve typical uncertainties of 110 K in Teff ($\sim$3%),
0.065 $R_{\odot}$ ($\sim$14%) in radius, 0.054 $M_{\odot}$ ($\sim$12%) in mass,
and 0.012 $L_{\odot}$ ($\sim$20%) in luminosity. The model presented here can
be rapidly applied to future LAMOST data releases, significantly extending the
samples of well-characterized M dwarfs across the sky using new and exclusively
data-based modeling methods.",2019-12-13T18:59:59Z
"Energy distribution of small-scale flares derived using genetic
  algorithm","To understand the mechanism of coronal heating, it is crucial to derive the
contribution of small-scale flares, the so-called nanoflares, to the heating up
of the solar corona. To date, several studies have tried to derive the
occurrence frequency distribution of flares as a function of energy to reveal
the contribution of small-scale flares. However, there are no studies that
derive the distribution with considering the following conditions: (1)
evolution of the coronal loop plasma heated by small-scale flares, (2) loops
smaller than the spatial resolution of the observed image, and (3)
multiwavelength observation. To take into account these conditions, we
introduce a new method to analyze small-scale flares statistically based on a
one-dimensional loop simulation and a machine learning technique, that is,
genetic algorithm. First, we obtain six channels of SDO/AIA light curves of the
active-region coronal loops. Second, we carry out many coronal loop simulations
and obtain the SDO/AIA light curves for each simulation in a pseudo-manner.
Third, using the genetic algorithm, we estimate the best combination of
simulated light curves that reproduce the observation. Consequently, the
observed coronal loops are heated by small-scale flares with energy flux larger
than that typically required to heat up an active region intermittently.
Moreover, we derive the occurrence frequency distribution which have various
power-law indices in the range from 1 to 3, which partially supports the
nanoflare heating model. In contrast, we find that $90\%$ of the coronal
heating is done by flares that have energy larger than $10^{25}~\mathrm{erg}$.",2020-11-12T14:04:53Z
"Gyro-Kinematic Ages for around 30,000 Kepler Stars","Estimating stellar ages is important for advancing our understanding of
stellar and exoplanet evolution and investigating the history of the Milky Way.
However, ages for low-mass stars are hard to infer as they evolve slowly on the
main sequence. In addition, empirical dating methods are difficult to calibrate
for low-mass stars as they are faint. In this work, we calculate ages for
Kepler F, G, and crucially K and M dwarfs, using their rotation and kinematic
properties. We apply the simple assumption that the velocity dispersion of
stars increases over time and adopt an age--velocity--dispersion relation (AVR)
to estimate average stellar ages for groupings of coeval stars. We calculate
the vertical velocity dispersion of stars in bins of absolute magnitude,
temperature, rotation period, and Rossby number and then convert velocity
dispersion to kinematic age via an AVR. Using this method, we estimate
gyro-kinematic ages for 29,949 Kepler stars with measured rotation periods. We
are able to estimate ages for clusters and asteroseismic stars with an RMS of
1.22 Gyr and 0.26 Gyr respectively. With our Astraea machine learning
algorithm, which predicts rotation periods, we suggest a new selection
criterion (a weight of 0.15) to increase the size of the McQuillian et al.
(2014) catalog of Kepler rotation periods by up to 25%. Using predicted
rotation periods, we estimated gyro-kinematic ages for stars without measured
rotation periods and found promising results by comparing 12 detailed
age--element abundance trends with literature values.",2021-02-02T21:49:48Z
"Observational and Theoretical Studies of 27 $δ$ Scuti Stars with
  Investigation of the Period-Luminosity Relation","The multi-color CCD photometric study of 27 Delta Scuti stars is presented.
By using approximately three years of photometric observations, we obtained the
times of maxima and magnitude changes during the observation time interval for
each star. The ephemerides of our Delta Scuti stars were calculated based on
the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method using the observed times of maxima
and the period of the stars' oscillations. We used the Gaia EDR3 parallaxes to
calculate the luminosities and also the absolute magnitudes of these Delta
Scuti stars. The fundamental physical parameters of all the stars in our sample
such as masses and radii were estimated. We determined the pulsation modes of
the stars based on the pulsation constants. Moreover, the period-luminosity
(P-L) relation of Delta Scuti stars was investigated and discussed. Then, by
using a machine learning classification, new P-L relations for fundamental and
overtone modes are presented.",2021-02-19T19:51:22Z
"Discovery of New Dipper Stars with K2: A Window into the Inner Disk
  Region of T Tauri Stars","In recent years a new class of Young Stellar Object has been defined,
referred to as dippers, where large transient drops in flux are observed. These
dips are too large to be attributed to stellar variability, last from hours to
days and can reduce the flux of a star by 10-50\%. This variability has been
attributed to occultations by warps or accretion columns near the inner edge of
circumstellar disks. Here we present 95 dippers in the Upper Scorpius
association and $\rho$ Ophiuchus cloud complex found in K2 Campaign 2 data
using supervised machine learning with a Random Forest classifier. We also
present 30 YSOs that exhibit brightening events on the order of days, known as
bursters. Not all dippers and bursters are known members, but all exhibit
infrared excesses and are consistent with belonging to either of the two young
star forming regions. We find 21.0 $\pm$ 5.5\% of stars with disks are dippers
for both regions combined. Our entire dipper sample consists only of late-type
(KM) stars, but we show that biases limit dipper discovery for earlier spectral
types. Using the dipper properties as a proxy, we find that the temperature at
the inner disk edge is consistent with interferometric results for similar and
earlier type stars.",2018-02-01T17:35:32Z
"Understanding Heating in Active Region Cores through Machine Learning I.
  Numerical Modeling and Predicted Observables","To adequately constrain the frequency of energy deposition in active region
cores in the solar corona, systematic comparisons between detailed models and
observational data are needed. In this paper, we describe a pipeline for
forward modeling active region emission using magnetic field extrapolations and
field-aligned hydrodynamic models. We use this pipeline to predict
time-dependent emission from active region NOAA 1158 as observed by SDO/AIA for
low-, intermediate-, and high-frequency nanoflares. In each pixel of our
predicted multi-wavelength, time-dependent images, we compute two commonly-used
diagnostics: the emission measure slope and the time lag. We find that
signatures of the heating frequency persist in both of these diagnostics. In
particular, our results show that the distribution of emission measure slopes
narrows and the mean decreases with decreasing heating frequency and that the
range of emission measure slopes is consistent with past observational and
modeling work. Furthermore, we find that the time lag becomes increasingly
spatially coherent with decreasing heating frequency while the distribution of
time lags across the whole active region becomes more broad with increasing
heating frequency. In a follow up paper, we train a random forest classifier on
these predicted diagnostics and use this model to classify real AIA
observations of NOAA 1158 in terms of the underlying heating frequency.",2019-06-07T22:41:39Z
"The ASAS-SN Catalog of Variable Stars IV: Periodic Variables in the
  APOGEE Survey","We explore the synergy between photometric and spectroscopic surveys by
searching for periodic variable stars among the targets observed by the Apache
Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) using photometry from
the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). We identified 1924
periodic variables among more than 258000 APOGEE targets; 465 are new
discoveries. We homogeneously classified 430 eclipsing and ellipsoidal
binaries, 139 classical pulsators (Cepheids, RR Lyrae and delta Scuti), 719
long period variables (pulsating red giants) and 636 rotational variables. The
search was performed using both visual inspection and machine learning
techniques. The light curves were also modeled with the damped random walk
stochastic process. We find that the median [Fe/H] of variable objects is lower
by 0.3 dex than that of the overall APOGEE sample. Eclipsing binaries and
ellipsoidal variables are shifted to a lower median [Fe/H] by 0.2 dex.
Eclipsing binaries and rotational variables exhibit significantly broader
spectral lines than the rest of the sample. We make ASAS-SN light curves for
all the APOGEE stars publicly available and provide parameters for the variable
objects.",2019-06-14T18:00:02Z
"Mimicking spectropolarimetric inversions using convolutional neural
  networks","Interpreting spectropolarimetric observations of the solar atmosphere takes
much longer than the acquiring the data. The most important reason for this is
that the model fitting, or ""inversion"", used to infer physical quantities from
the observations is extremely slow, because the underlying models are
numerically demanding. We aim to improve the speed of the inference by using a
neural network that relates input polarized spectra to the output physical
parameters. We first select a subset of the data to be interpreted and infer
physical quantities from corresponding spectra using a standard
minimization-based inversion code. Taking these results as reliable and
representative of the whole data set, we train a convolutional neural network
to connect the input polarized spectra to the output physical parameters
(nodes, in context of spectropolarimetric inversion). We then apply the neural
network to the various other data, previously unseen to the network. As a
check, we apply the referent inversion code to the unseen data and compare the
fit quality and the maps of the inferred parameters between the two inversions.
The physical parameters inferred by the neural network show excellent agreement
with the results from the inversion, and are obtained in a factor of $10^5$
less time. Additionally, substituting the results of the neural network back in
the forward model, shows excellent agreement between inferred and original
spectra. The method we present here is very simple for implementation and
extremely fast. It only requires a training data set, which can be obtained by
inverting a representative subset of the observed data. Applying these (and
similar) machine learning techniques will yield orders of magnitude
acceleration in the routine interpretation of spectropolarimetric data.",2020-06-03T01:31:13Z
"Exploring mutual information between IRIS spectral lines. I.
  Correlations between spectral lines during solar flares and within the quiet
  Sun","Spectral lines allow us to probe the thermodynamics of the solar atmosphere,
but the shape of a single spectral line may be similar for different
thermodynamic solutions. Multiline analyses are therefore crucial, but
computationally cumbersome. We investigate correlations between several
chromospheric and transition region lines to restrain the thermodynamic
solutions of the solar atmosphere during flares. We used machine-learning
methods to capture the statistical dependencies between 6 spectral lines
sourced from 21 large solar flares observed by NASA's Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph (IRIS). The techniques are based on an information-theoretic
quantity called mutual information (MI), which captures both linear and
nonlinear correlations between spectral lines. The MI is estimated using both a
categorical and numeric method, and performed separately for a collection of
quiet Sun and flaring observations. Both approaches return consistent results,
indicating weak correlations between spectral lines under quiet Sun conditions,
and substantially enhanced correlations under flaring conditions, with some
line-pairs such as Mg II and C II having a normalized MI score as high as 0.5.
We find that certain spectral lines couple more readily than others, indicating
a coherence in the solar atmosphere over many scale heights during flares, and
that all line-pairs are correlated to the GOES derivative, indicating a
positive relationship between correlation strength and energy input. Our
methods provide a highly stable and flexible framework for quantifying
dependencies between the physical quantities of the solar atmosphere, allowing
us to obtain a three-dimensional picture of its state.",2021-04-25T13:46:24Z
"Understanding Heating in Active Region Cores through Machine Learning
  II. Classifying Observations","Constraining the frequency of energy deposition in magnetically-closed active
region cores requires sophisticated hydrodynamic simulations of the coronal
plasma and detailed forward modeling of the optically-thin line-of-sight
integrated emission. However, understanding which set of model inputs best
matches a set of observations is complicated by the need for any proposed
heating model to simultaneously satisfy multiple observable constraints. In
this paper, we train a random forest classification model on a set of
forward-modeled observable quantities, namely the emission measure slope, the
peak temperature of the emission measure distribution, and the time lag and
maximum cross-correlation between multiple pairs of AIA channels. We then use
our trained model to classify the heating frequency in every pixel of active
region NOAA 1158 using the observed emission measure slopes, peak temperatures,
time lags, and maximum cross-correlations and are able to map the heating
frequency across the entire active region. We find that high-frequency heating
dominates in the inner core of the active region while intermediate frequency
dominates closer to the periphery of the active region. Additionally, we assess
the importance of each observed quantity in our trained classification model
and find that the emission measure slope is the dominant feature in deciding
with which heating frequency a given pixel is most consistent. The technique
presented here offers a very promising and widely applicable method for
assessing observations in terms of detailed forward models given an arbitrary
number of observable constraints.",2021-07-15T21:16:50Z
"Could the Magnetic Star HD 135348 Possess a Rigidly Rotating
  Magnetosphere?","We report the detection and characterization of a new magnetospheric star, HD
135348, based on photometric and spectropolarimetric observations. The TESS
light curve of this star exhibited variations consistent with stars known to
possess rigidly rotating magnetospheres (RRMs), so we obtained
spectropolarimetric observations using the Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS) on
the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) at four different rotational
phases. From these observations, we calculated the longitudinal magnetic field
of the star $\langle B_z \rangle$, as well as the Alfv\'en and Kepler radii,
and deduced that this star contains a centrifugal magnetosphere. However, an
archival spectrum does not exhibit the characteristic ""double-horned"" emission
profile for H$\alpha$ and the Brackett series that has been observed in many
other RRM stars. This could be due to the insufficient rotational phase
coverage of the available set of observations, as the spectra of these stars
significantly vary with the star's rotation. Our analysis underscores the use
of TESS in photometrically identifying magnetic star candidates for
spectropolarimetric follow-up using ground-based instruments. We are evaluating
the implementation of a machine learning classifier to search for more examples
of RRM stars in TESS data.",2021-12-14T19:00:00Z
"Discovery of a Short Period Pulsator from Istanbul University
  Observatory","We report the discovery of a new short period pulsating variable in the field
of exoplanet host star XO-2. Variable has been identified while it was being
used as a comparison star. In order to verify the variability of the candidate,
a follow-up program was carried out. Period analysis of multi-band light curves
revealed a very prominent and consistent pulsation periodicity of $P\sim0.95$
hours. Given the variability period, amplitude and the color index, the object
is most likely a \emph{Delta Scuti} type variable. Absolute magnitude ($M_{v}$)
and the color index $(B-V)_{0}$ of the star determined as $2.76$ and $0.22$,
respectively. This $(B-V)_{0}$ of the star corresponds to A7 spectral type with
an approximate effective temperature of 7725 K. Machine-learning analysis of
the time-series data also revealed that the object is of variable type DSCT
with a probability of 78\%.",2022-06-29T13:25:33Z
"Forward modelling and the quest for mode identification in
  rapidly-rotating stars","Asteroseismology has opened a window on the internal physics of thousands of
stars, by relating oscillation spectra properties to the internal physics of
stars. Mode identification, namely the process of associating a measured
oscillation frequency to the corresponding mode geometry and properties, is the
cornerstone of this analysis of seismic spectra. In rapidly rotating stars this
identification is a challenging task that remains incomplete, as modes assume
complex geometries and regular patterns in frequencies get scrambled under the
influence of the Coriolis force and centrifugal flattening.
  In this article, I will first discuss the various classes of mode geometries
that emerge in rapidly-rotating stars and the related frequency and period
patterns, as predicted by ray dynamics, complete (non-)adiabatic calculations,
or using the traditional approximation of rotation. These patterns scale with
structural quantities and help us derive crucial constraints on the structure
and evolution of these stars. I will summarize the amazing progress
accomplished over the last few years for the deciphering of gravity-mode
pulsator oscillation spectra, and recent developments based on machine-learning
classification techniques to distinguish oscillation modes and pattern analysis
strategies that let us access the underlying physics of pressure-mode
pulsators. These approaches pave the way to ensemble asteroseismology of
classical pulsators.
  Finally, I will highlight how these recent progress can be combined to
improve forward seismic modelling. I will focus on the example of Rasalhague, a
well-known rapid rotator, to illustrate the process and the needed advances to
obtain \`a-la-carte modelling of such stars.",2022-09-20T01:40:40Z
"Surface magnetism of rapidly rotating red giants: single versus close
  binary stars","According to dynamo theory, stars with convective envelopes efficiently
generate surface magnetic fields, which manifest as magnetic activity in the
form of starspots, faculae, flares, when their rotation period is shorter than
their convective turnover time. Most red giants, having undergone significant
spin down while expanding, have slow rotation and no spots. However, based on a
sample of about 4500 red giants observed by the NASA Kepler mission, a previous
study showed that about 8 % display spots, including about 15 % that belong to
close binary systems. Here, we shed light on a puzzling fact: for rotation
periods less than 80 days, a red giant that belongs to a close binary system
displays a photometric modulation about an order of magnitude larger than that
of a single red giant with similar rotational period and physical properties.
We investigate whether binarity leads to larger magnetic fields when tides lock
systems, or if a different spot distribution on single versus close binary
stars can explain this fact. For this, we measure the chromospheric emission in
the CaII H & K lines of 3130 of the 4465 stars studied in a previous work
thanks to the LAMOST survey. We show that red giants in a close-binary
configuration with spin-orbit resonance display significantly larger
chromospheric emission than single stars, suggesting that tidal locking leads
to larger magnetic fields at a fixed rotational period. Beyond bringing
interesting new observables to study the evolution of binary systems, this
result could be used to distinguish single versus binary red giants in
automatic pipelines based on machine learning.",2022-11-02T10:43:22Z
Nanoflare Heating of the Solar Corona Observed in X-rays,"The existence of the million-degree corona above the cooler photosphere is an
unsolved problem in astrophysics. Detailed study of quiescent corona that
exists regardless of the phase of the solar cycle may provide fruitful hints
towards resolving this conundrum. However, the properties of heating mechanisms
can be obtained only statistically in these regions due to their unresolved
nature. Here, we develop a two-step inversion scheme based on the machine
learning scheme of Upendran & Tripathi (2021a) for the empirical impulsive
heating model of Pauluhn & Solanki (2007), and apply it to disk integrated flux
measurements of the quiet corona as measured by the X-ray solar monitor (XSM)
onboard Chandrayaan - 2. We use data in three energy passbands, viz., 1 - 1.3
keV, 1.3 - 2.3 keV, and 1 - 2.3 keV, and estimate the typical impulsive event
frequencies, timescales, amplitudes, and the distribution of amplitudes. We
find that the impulsive events occur at a frequency of $\approx$25 events per
minute with a typical lifetime of $\approx10$ minutes. They are characterized
by a power law distribution with a slope $\alpha\leq2.0$. The typical
amplitudes of these events lie in an energy range of $10^{21}$ - $10^{24}$
ergs, with a typical radiative loss of about $\approx10^3$ erg cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ in the energy range of 1 - 2.3 keV. These results provide further
constraints on the properties of sub-pixel impulsive events in maintaining the
quiet solar corona.",2022-11-04T09:00:03Z
"Chromospheric and Coronal heating in active region plage by dissipation
  of currents from braiding","It remains unclear which physical processes are responsible for the dramatic
increase with height of the temperature in stellar atmospheres, known as the
chromospheric ($\sim$10,000 K) and coronal (several million K) heating
problems. Statistical studies of sun-like stars reveal that chromospheric and
coronal emissions are correlated on a global scale, constraining, in principle,
theoretical models of potential heating mechanisms. However, so far, spatially
resolved observations of the Sun have surprisingly failed to show a similar
correlation on small spatial scales, leaving models poorly constrained. Here we
use unique coordinated high-resolution observations of the chromosphere (from
the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph or IRIS satellite) and low corona
(from the Hi-C 2.1 sounding rocket), and machine-learning based inversion
techniques to show a strong correlation on spatial scales of a few hundred km
between heating in the chromosphere and low corona for regions with strong
magnetic field (""plage""). These results are compatible with recent advanced 3D
radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations in which dissipation of current
sheets formed due to the braiding of the magnetic field lines deep in the
atmosphere is responsible for heating the plasma simultaneously to
chromospheric and coronal temperatures. Our results provide deep insight into
the nature of the heating mechanism in solar active regions.",2022-11-15T23:51:04Z
"High Resolution Observations of the Low Atmospheric Response to Small
  Coronal Heating Events in an Active Region Core","High resolution spectral observations of the lower solar atmosphere
(chromosphere and transition region) during coronal heating events, in
combination with predictions from models of impulsively heated loops, provide
powerful diagnostics of the properties of the heating in active region cores.
Here we analyze the first coordinated observations of such events with the
Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the CHROMospheric Imaging
Spectrometer (CHROMIS), at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST), which
provided extremely high spatial resolution and revealed chromospheric
brightenings with spatial dimensions down to ~150km. We use machine learning
methods (k-means clustering) and find significant coherence in the spatial and
temporal properties of the chromospheric spectra, suggesting, in turn,
coherence in the spatial and temporal distribution of the coronal heating. The
comparison of IRIS and CHROMIS spectra with simulations suggest that both
non-thermal electrons with low energy (low-energy cutoff ~5keV) and direct
heating in the corona transported by thermal conduction contribute to the
heating of the low atmosphere. This is consistent with growing evidence that
non-thermal electrons are not uncommon in small heating events (nano- to
micro-flares), and that their properties can be constrained by chromospheric
and transition region spectral observations.",2023-08-29T16:22:17Z
"101 Eclipsing Quadruple Star Candidates Discovered in TESS Full Frame
  Images","We present our second catalog of quadruple star candidates, containing 101
systems discovered in TESS Full-Frame Image data. The targets were initially
detected as eclipsing binary stars with the help of supervised machine learning
methods applied to sectors Sectors 1 through 54. A dedicated team of citizen
scientists subsequently identified through visual inspection two sets of
eclipses following two different periods. All 101 systems presented here pass
comprehensive photocenter motion tests confirming that both sets of eclipses
originate from the target star. Some of the systems exhibit prominent eclipse
time variations suggesting dynamical interactions between the two component
binary stars. One target is an eclipsing quintuple candidate with a (2+1)+2
hierarchical configuration, such that the (2+1) subsystem produces eclipses on
the triple orbit as well. Another has recently been confirmed as the second
shortest period quadruple reported to date. This catalog provides ephemerides,
eclipse depths and durations, sample statistics, and highlights potentially
interesting targets for future studies.",2023-09-25T15:00:42Z
"Asteroseismology applied to constrain structure parameters of δ
  Scuti stars","Asteroseismology is a powerful tool to probe the structure of stars.
Space-borne instruments like CoRoT, Kepler and TESS have observed the
oscillations of numerous stars, among which {\delta} Scutis are particularly
interesting owing to their fast rotation rates and complex pulsation
mechanisms. In this work, we inferred model-dependent masses, metallicities and
ages of 60 {\delta} Scuti stars from their photometric, spectroscopic and
asteroseismic observations using least-squares minimization. These statistics
have the potential to explain why only a tiny fraction of {\delta} Sct stars
pulsate in a very clean manner. We find most of these stars with masses around
1.6 {M_\odot} and metallicities below Z = 0.010. We observed a bimodality in
age for these stars, with more than half the sample younger than 30 Myr, while
the remaining ones were inferred to be older, i.e., hundreds of Myrs. This work
emphasizes the importance of the large-frequency separation ({\Delta\nu}) in
studies of {\delta} Scuti stars. We also designed three machine learning (ML)
models that hold the potential for inferring these parameters at lower
computational cost and much more rapidly. These models further revealed that
constraining dipole modes can help in significantly improving age estimation
and that radial modes succinctly encode information pertaining to stellar
luminosity and temperature. Using the ML models, we also gained qualitative
insight into the importance of stellar observables in estimating mass,
metallicity, and age. The effective surface temperature T eff strongly affects
the inference of all structure parameters and the asteroseismic offset
parameter {\epsilon} plays an essential role in the inference of age.",2023-10-11T05:30:19Z
"Physical Properties of 5,000 Cool LMC Supergiants with Gaia XP Spectra:
  A Detailed Portrait of the Upper HR Diagram Hints at Missing Supernova
  Progenitors","Characterizing the physical properties of cool supergiants allows us to probe
the final stages of a massive star's evolution before it undergoes core
collapse. Despite their importance, the fundamental properties for these stars
-- $T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log L/L_\odot$ -- are only known for a limited number of
objects. The third data release of the Gaia mission contains precise photometry
and low-resolution spectroscopy of hundreds of cool supergiants in the LMC with
well-constrained properties. Using these data, we train a simple and
easily-interpretable machine learning model to regress effective temperatures
and luminosities with high accuracy and precision comparable to the training
data. We then apply our model to 5000 cool supergiants, many of which have no
previously-published $T_{\rm eff}$ or $L$ estimates. The resulting
Hertzprung-Russell diagram is well-populated, allowing us to study the
distribution of cool supergiants in great detail. Examining the luminosity
functions of our sample, we find a notable flattening in the luminosity
function of yellow supergiants above $\log L/L_\odot=5$, and a corresponding
steepening of the red supergiant luminosity function. We place this finding in
context with previous results, and present its implications for the infamous
red supergiant problem.",2023-10-24T18:00:02Z
Global Parameters of Eight W UMa-type Binary Systems,"Multiband photometric investigations for eight binary systems of the W Ursae
Majoris (W UMa)-type are presented. Six systems are presented for the first
time to analyze their light curves. All the analyzed systems have a temperature
below 5000 K and an orbital period of less than 0.28 days. We extracted primary
and secondary minima from the ground-based observations of these systems.
According to a few observations reported in the literature, linear fits were
considered in the O-C diagrams, and new ephemerides were presented. Light curve
solutions were performed using the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) code.
The results of the mass ratio and fillout factor indicate that the systems are
contact binary stars. Six of them showed the O'Connell effect, and a cold
starspot on each companion was required for light curve solutions. Their
absolute parameters were estimated and evaluated by two other methods. In this
study, the empirical relationship between the orbital period and semi-major
axis was updated using a sample consisting of 414 contact binary systems and
the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approach. Also, using Machine Learning (ML)
and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, the relationship between
$P-T_1-M_1$ was updated for a better estimation of the mass of the primary
star.",2024-01-18T11:34:18Z
OGLE-III Microlensing Events and the Structure of the Galactic Bulge,"We present and study the largest and the most comprehensive catalog of
microlensing events ever constructed. The sample of standard microlensing
events comprises 3718 unique events from years 2001--2009, with 1409 not
detected before in real-time by the Early Warning System of the Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). The search pipeline makes use of
Machine Learning algorithms in order to help find rare phenomena among 150
million objects and derive the detection efficiency. Applications of the
catalog can be numerous, from analyzing individual events to large statistical
studies for the Galactic mass and kinematics distributions and planetary
abundances.
  We derive the maps of the mean Einstein ring crossing time of events spanning
31 sq. deg. toward of the Galactic Center and compare the observed
distributions with the most recent models. We find good agreement within the
observed region and we see the signature of the tilt of the bar in the
microlensing data. However, the asymmetry of the mean time-scales seems to rise
more steeply than predictions, indicating either a somewhat different
orientation of the bar or a larger bar width. The map for the events with
sources in the Galactic bulge shows a dependence of the mean time-scale on the
Galactic latitude, signaling an increasing contribution from disk lenses closer
to the plane, related with the height of the disk. Our data present a perfect
set for comparing and enhancing new models of the central parts of the Milky
Way and creating the 3D picture of the Galaxy.",2014-05-13T12:56:05Z
"Determination of pulsation periods and other parameters of 2875 stars
  classified as MIRA in the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS)","We have developed an interactive PYTHON code and derived crucial ephemeris
data of 99.4% of all stars classified as 'Mira' in the ASAS data base,
referring to pulsation periods, mean maximum magnitudes and, whenever possible,
the amplitudes among others. We present a statistical comparison between our
results and those given by the AAVSO International Variable Star Index (VSX),
as well as those determined with the machine learning automatic procedure of
Richards et al. 2012. Our periods are in good agreement with those of the VSX
in more than 95% of the stars. However, when comparing our periods with those
of Richards et al, the coincidence rate is only 76% and most of the remaining
cases refer to aliases. We conclude that automatic codes require still more
refinements in order to provide reliable period values. Period distributions of
the target stars show three local maxima around 215, 275 and 330 d, apparently
of universal validity, their relative strength seems to depend on galactic
longitude. Our visual amplitude distribution turns out to be bimodal, however
1/3 of the targets have rather small amplitudes (A $<$ 2.5$^{m}$) and could
refer to semi-regular variables (SR). We estimate that about 20% of our targets
belong to the SR class. We also provide a list of 63 candidates for period
variations and a sample of 35 multiperiodic stars which seem to confirm the
universal validity of typical sequences in the double period and in the
Petersen diagrams",2016-09-16T21:45:06Z
"A First Catalog of Variable Stars Measured by the Asteroid
  Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)","The Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) carries out its
primary planetary defense mission by surveying about 13000 deg^2 at least four
times per night. The resulting data set is useful for the discovery of variable
stars to a magnitude limit fainter than r~18, with amplitudes down to 0.01 mag
for bright objects. Here we present a Data Release One catalog of variable
stars based on analyzing 142 million stars measured at least 100 times in the
first two years of ATLAS operations. Using a Lomb-Scargle periodogram and other
variability metrics, we identify 4.7 million candidate variables which we
analyze in detail. Through Space Telescope Science Institute, we publicly
release lightcurves for all of them, together with a vector of 169
classification features for each star. We do this at the level of unconfirmed
candidate variables in order to provide the community with a large set of
homogeneously analyzed photometry and avoid pre-judging which types of objects
others may find most interesting. We use machine learning to classify the
candidates into fifteen different broad categories based on lightcurve
morphology. About 10% (430,000 stars) pass extensive tests designed to screen
out spurious variability detections: we label these as `probable' variables. Of
these, 230,000 receive specific classifications as eclipsing binaries,
pulsating, Mira-type, or sinusoidal variables: these are the `classified'
variables. New discoveries among the probable variables number more than
300,000, while 150,000 of the classified variables are new, including about
10,000 pulsating variables, 2,000 Mira stars, and 70,000 eclipsing binaries.",2018-04-06T05:01:10Z
"FliPer: A global measure of power density to estimate surface gravities
  of main-sequence Solar-like stars and red giants","Asteroseismology provides global stellar parameters such as masses, radii or
surface gravities using the mean global seismic parameters as well as the
effective temperature for thousands of low-mass stars $(0.8 M_\odot <M<3
M_\odot)$. This methodology has been successfully applied to stars in which
acoustic modes excited by turbulent convection are measured. Other techniques
such as the Flicker can also be used to determine stellar surface gravities,
but only works for $\log{g}$ above $2.5$ dex. In this work, we present a new
metric called FliPer (the acronym stands for Flicker in spectral power density,
in opposition to the standard Flicker measurement which is computed in the time
domain that is able to extend the range for which reliable surface gravities
can be obtained ($0.1<\log{g}<4.6$ dex) without performing any seismic analysis
for stars brighter than $\textit{Kp}$ $<$ 14. FliPer takes into account the
average variability of a star measured in the power density spectrum in a given
range of frequencies. However, FliPer values calculated on several ranges of
frequency are required to better characterize a star. Using a large set of
asteroseismic targets it is possible to calibrate the behavior of surface
gravity with FliPer through machine learning. This calibration made with a
random forest regressor covers a wide range of surface gravities from
main-sequence stars to subgiants and red giants, with very small uncertainties
from $0.04$ to $0.1$ dex. FliPer values can be inserted in automatic global
seismic pipelines to either give an estimation of the stellar surface gravity
or to assess the quality of the seismic results by detecting any outliers in
the obtained $\nu_{max}$ values. FliPer also constrain the surface gravities of
main-sequence dwarfs using only long cadence data for which the Nyquist
frequency is too low to measure the acoustic-mode properties.",2018-09-13T18:00:05Z
Metallic-Line Stars Identified from Low Resolution Spectra of LAMOST DR5,"LAMOST DR5 released more than 200,000 low resolution spectra of early-type
stars with S/N>50. Searching for metallic-line (Am) stars in such a large
database and study of their statistical properties are presented in this paper.
Six machine learning algorithms were experimented with using known Am spectra,
and both the empirical criteria method(Hou et al. 2015) and the MKCLASS
package(Gray et al. 2016) were also investigated. Comparing their performance,
the random forest (RF) algorithm won, not only because RF has high successful
rate but also it can derives and ranks features. Then the RF was applied to the
early type stars of DR5, and 15,269 Am candidates were picked out. Manual
identification was conducted based on the spectral features derived from the RF
algorithm and verified by experts. After manual identification, 9,372 Am stars
and 1,131 Ap candidates were compiled into a catalog. Statistical studies were
conducted including temperature distribution, space distribution, and infrared
photometry. The spectral types of Am stars are mainly between F0 and A4 with a
peak around A7, which is similar to previous works. With the Gaia distances, we
calculated the vertical height Z from the Galactic plane for each Am star. The
distribution of Z suggests that the incidence rate of Am stars shows a
descending gradient with increasing jZj. On the other hand, Am stars do not
show a noteworthy pattern in the infrared band. As wavelength gets longer, the
infrared excess of Am stars decreases, until little or no excess in W1 and W2
bands.",2019-04-05T19:06:52Z
Variables in the Southern Polar Region Evryscope 2016 Dataset,"The regions around the celestial poles offer the ability to find and
characterize long-term variables from ground-based observatories. We used
multi-year Evryscope data to search for high-amplitude (~5% or greater)
variable objects among 160,000 bright stars (Mv < 14.5) near the South
Celestial Pole. We developed a machine learning based spectral classifier to
identify eclipse and transit candidates with M-dwarf or K-dwarf host stars -
and potential low-mass secondary stars or gas giant planets. The large
amplitude transit signals from low-mass companions of smaller dwarf host stars
lessens the photometric precision and systematics removal requirements
necessary for detection, and increases the discoveries from long-term
observations with modest light curve precision. The Evryscope is a robotic
telescope array that observes the Southern sky continuously at 2-minute
cadence, searching for stellar variability, transients, transits around exotic
stars and other observationally challenging astrophysical variables. In this
study, covering all stars 9 < Mv < 14.5, in declinations -75 to -90 deg, we
recover 346 known variables and discover 303 new variables, including 168
eclipsing binaries. We characterize the discoveries and provide the amplitudes,
periods, and variability type. A 1.7 Jupiter radius planet candidate with a
late K-dwarf primary was found and the transit signal was verified with the
PROMPT telescope network. Further followup revealed this object to be a likely
grazing eclipsing binary system with nearly identical primary and secondary K5
stars. Radial velocity measurements from the Goodman Spectrograph on the 4.1
meter SOAR telescope of the likely-lowest-mass targets reveal that six of the
eclipsing binary discoveries are low-mass (.06 - .37 solar mass) secondaries
with K-dwarf primaries, strong candidates for precision mass-radius
measurements.",2019-05-07T18:01:04Z
"The EREBOS project -- Investigating the effect of substellar and
  low-mass stellar companions on late stellar evolution","Eclipsing post-common envelope binaries are highly important for resolving
the poorly understood, very short-lived common envelope phase. Most hot
subdwarfs (sdO/Bs) are the bare He-burning cores of red giants which have lost
almost all of their hydrogen envelopes. This mass loss is often triggered by
common envelope interactions with close stellar or even sub-stellar companions.
In the recently published catalog of eclipsing binaries in the Galactic Bulge
and in the ATLAS survey, we discovered 161 new eclipsing systems showing a
reflection effect by visual inspection of the light curves and using a
machine-learning algorithm. The EREBOS (Eclipsing Reflection Effect Binaries
from Optical Surveys) project aims at analyzing all newly discovered eclipsing
binaries with reflection effect based on a spectroscopic and photometric follow
up. To constrain the nature of the primary we derived the absolute magnitude
and the reduced proper motion of all our targets with the help of the
parallaxes and proper motions measured by the Gaia mission and compared those
to the Gaia white dwarf catalogue. For a sub-set of our targets with observed
spectra the nature could be derived by measuring the atmospheric parameter of
the primary confirming that less than 10\% of our systems are not sdO/Bs with
cool companions but white dwarfs or central stars of planetary nebula. This
large sample of eclipsing hot subdwarfs with cool companions allowed us to
derive a significant period distribution for hot subdwarfs with cool companions
for the first time showing that the period distribution is much broader than
previously thought and ideally suited to find the lowest mass companions to hot
subdwarf stars. In the future several new photometric surveys will be carried
out, which will increase the sample of this project even more giving the
potential to test many aspects of common envelope theory and binary evolution.",2019-07-23T14:09:06Z
"Supervised convolutional neural networks for classification of flaring
  and nonflaring active regions using line-of-sight magnetograms","Solar flares are explosions in the solar atmosphere that release intense
bursts of short-wavelength radiation and are capable of producing severe
space-weather consequences. Flares release free energy built up in coronal
fields, which are rooted in active regions (ARs) on the photosphere, via
magnetic reconnection. The exact processes that lead to reconnection are not
fully known and therefore reliable forecasting of flares is challenging.
Recently, photospheric magnetic-field data has been extensively analysed using
machine learning (ML) and these studies suggest that flare-forecasting accuracy
does not strongly depend on how long in advance flares are predicted (Bobra &
Couvidat 2015; Raboonik et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2018). Here, we use ML to
understand the evolution of AR magnetic fields before and after flares. We
explicitly train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify SDO/HMI
line-of-sight magnetograms into ARs producing at least one M- or X-class flare
or as nonflaring. We find that flaring ARs remain in flare-productive states --
marked by recall >60% with a peak of ~ 80% -- days before and after flares. We
use occlusion maps and statistical analysis to show that the CNN pays attention
to regions between the opposite polarities from ARs and the CNN output is
dominantly decided by the total unsigned line-of-sight flux of ARs. Using
synthetic bipole magnetograms, we find spurious dependencies of the CNN output
on magnetogram dimensions for a given bipole size. Our results suggest that it
is important to use CNN designs that eliminate such artifacts in CNN
applications for processing magnetograms and, in general, solar image data.",2020-05-27T13:00:57Z
FliPer$_{Class}$: In search of solar-like pulsators among TESS targets,"The NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is about to provide
full-frame images of almost the entire sky. The amount of stellar data to be
analysed represents hundreds of millions stars, which is several orders of
magnitude above the amount of stars observed by CoRoT, Kepler, or K2 missions.
We aim at automatically classifying the newly observed stars, with near
real-time algorithms, to better guide their subsequent detailed studies. In
this paper, we present a classification algorithm built to recognise solar-like
pulsators among classical pulsators, which relies on the global amount of power
contained in the PSD, also known as the FliPer (Flicker in spectral Power
density). As each type of pulsating star has a characteristic background or
pulsation pattern, the shape of the PSD at different frequencies can be used to
characterise the type of pulsating star. The FliPer Classifier
(FliPer$_{Class}$) uses different FliPer parameters along with the effective
temperature as input parameters to feed a machine learning algorithm in order
to automatically classify the pulsating stars observed by TESS. Using noisy
TESS simulated data from the TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium (TASC), we
manage to classify pulsators with a 98% accuracy. Among them, solar-like
pulsating stars are recognised with a 99% accuracy, which is of great interest
for further seismic analysis of these stars like our Sun. Similar results are
obtained when training our classifier and applying it to 27 days subsets of
real Kepler data. FliPer$_{Class}$ is part of the large TASC classification
pipeline developed by the TESS Data for Asteroseismology (T'DA) classification
working group.",2019-02-26T10:45:48Z
"Insights from the APOKASC Determination of the Evolutionary State of
  Red-Giant Stars by consolidation of different methods","The internal working of low-mass stars is of great significance to both the
study of stellar structure and the history of the Milky Way. Asteroseismology
has the power to directly sense the internal structure of stars and allows for
the determination of the evolutionary state -- i.e. has helium burning
commenced or is the energy generated only by the fusion in the hydrogen-burning
shell? We use observational data from red-giant stars in a combination (known
as APOKASC) of asteroseismology (from the \textit{Kepler} mission) and
spectroscopy (from SDSS/APOGEE). The new feature of the analysis is that the
APOKASC evolutionary state determination is based on the comparison of diverse
approaches to the investigation of the frequency-power spectrum. The high level
of agreement between the methods is a strong validation of the approaches.
Stars for which there is not a consensus view are readily identified. The
comparison also facilitates the identification of unusual stars including those
that show evidence for very strong coupling between p and g cavities. The
comparison between the classification based on the spectroscopic data and
asteroseismic data have led to a new value for the statistical uncertainty in
APOGEE temperatures. These consensus evolutionary states will be used as an
input for methods that derive masses and ages for these stars based on
comparison of observables with stellar evolutionary models (`grid-based
modeling') and as a training set for machine-learning and other data-driven
methods of evolutionary state determination",2019-09-13T14:43:38Z
"Solar Flares Forecasting Using Time Series and Extreme Gradient Boosting
  Ensembles","Space weather events may cause damage to several fields, including aviation,
satellites, oil and gas industries, and electrical systems, leading to economic
and commercial losses. Solar flares are one of the most significant events, and
refer to sudden radiation releases that can affect the Earth's atmosphere
within a few hours or minutes. Therefore, it is worth designing
high-performance systems for forecasting such events. Although in the
literature there are many approaches for flare forecasting, there is still a
lack of consensus concerning the techniques used for designing these systems.
Seeking to establish some standardization while designing flare predictors, in
this study we propose a novel methodology for designing such predictors,
further validated with extreme gradient boosting tree classifiers and time
series. This methodology relies on the following well-defined machine learning
based pipeline: (i) univariate feature selection; (ii) randomized
hyper-parameter optimization; (iii) imbalanced data treatment; (iv) adjustment
of cut-off point of classifiers; and (v) evaluation under operational settings.
To verify our methodology effectiveness, we designed and evaluated three
proof-of-concept models for forecasting $\geq C$ class flares up to 72 hours
ahead. Compared to baseline models, those models were able to significantly
increase their scores of true skill statistics (TSS) under operational
forecasting scenarios by 0.37 (predicting flares in the next 24 hours), 0.13
(predicting flares within 24-48 hours), and 0.36 (predicting flares within
48-72 hours). Besides increasing TSS, the methodology also led to significant
increases in the area under the ROC curve, corroborating that we improved the
positive and negative recalls of classifiers while decreasing the number of
false alarms.",2020-04-28T04:49:09Z
"Determining the dynamics and magnetic fields in He I 10830 Å during
  a solar filament eruption","We investigate the dynamics and magnetic properties of the plasma, such as
line-of-sight velocity (LOS), optical depth, vertical and horizontal magnetic
fields, belonging to an erupted solar filament. The filament eruption was
observed with the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) at the 1.5-meter GREGOR
telescope on 2016 July 3. Three consecutive full-Stokes
slit-spectropolarimetric scans in the He I 10830 \r{A} spectral range were
acquired. The Stokes I profiles were classified using the machine learning
k-means algorithm and then inverted with different initial conditions using the
HAZEL code. The erupting-filament material presents the following physical
conditions: (1) ubiquitous upward motions with peak LOS velocities of ~73 km/s;
(2) predominant large horizontal components of the magnetic field, on average,
in the range of 173-254 G, whereas the vertical components of the fields are
much lower, on average between 39-58 G; (3) optical depths in the range of
0.7-1.1. The average azimuth orientation of the field lines between two
consecutive raster scans (<2.5 minutes) remained constant. The analyzed
filament eruption belonged to the fast rising phase, with total velocities of
about 124 km/s. The orientation of the magnetic field lines does not change
from one raster scan to the other, indicating that the untwisting phase has not
started yet. The untwisting seems to start about 15 min after the beginning of
the filament eruption.",2020-06-18T12:43:04Z
"Atmospheric parameters of Cepheids from flux ratios with ATHOS: I. The
  temperature scale","Context: The effective temperature is a key parameter governing the
properties of a star. For stellar chemistry, it has the strongest impact on the
accuracy of the abundances derived. Since Cepheids are pulsating stars,
determining their effective temperature is more complicated that in the case of
non-variable stars. Aims: We want to provide a new temperature scale for
classical Cepheids, with a high precision and full control of the systematics.
Methods: Using a data-driven machine learning technique employing observed
spectra, and taking great care to accurately phase single-epoch observations,
we have tied flux ratios to (label) temperatures derived using the infrared
surface brightness method. Results: We identified 143 flux ratios that allow us
to determine the effective temperature with a precision of a few K and an
accuracy better than 150 K, which is in line with the most accurate temperature
measures available to date. The method does not require a normalization of the
input spectra and provides homogeneous temperatures for low- and
high-resolution spectra, even at the lowest signal-to-noise ratios. Due to the
lack of a dataset of sufficient sample size for Small Magellanic Cloud
Cepheids, the temperature scale does not extend to Cepheids with [Fe/H] < -0.6
dex but nevertheless provides an exquisite, homogeneous means of characterizing
Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheids. Conclusions: The temperature
scale will be extremely useful in the context of spectroscopic surveys for
Milky Way archaeology with the WEAVE and 4MOST spectrographs. It paves the way
for highly accurate and precise metallicity estimates, which will allow us to
assess the possible metallicity dependence of Cepheids' period-luminosity
relations and, in turn, to improve our measurement of the Hubble constant H0.",2020-06-25T18:00:14Z
"A new view of the solar interface region from the Interface Region
  Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS)","The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) has been obtaining near- and
far-ultraviolet images and spectra of the solar atmosphere since July 2013. The
unique combination of near and far-ultraviolet spectra and images at
subarcsecond resolution and high cadence allows the tracing of mass and energy
through the critical interface between the solar surface and the corona or
solar wind. IRIS has enabled research into the fundamental physical processes
thought to play a role in the low solar atmosphere such as ion-neutral
interactions, magnetic reconnection, the generation, propagation, and
dissipation of various types of waves, the acceleration of non-thermal
particles, and various small-scale instabilities. These new findings have
helped provide novel insights into a wide range of phenomena including the
discovery of non-thermal particles in coronal nanoflares, the formation and
impact of spicules and other jets, resonant absorption and dissipation of
Alfvenic waves, energy release associated with braiding of magnetic field
lines, the thermal instability in the chromosphere-corona mass and energy
cycle, the contribution of waves, turbulence, and non-thermal particles in the
energy deposition during flares and smaller-scale events such as UV bursts, and
the role of flux ropes and other mechanisms in triggering CMEs. IRIS
observations have also advanced studies of the connections between solar and
stellar physics. Advances in numerical modeling, inversion codes, and machine
learning techniques have played a key role in driving these new insights. With
the advent of exciting new instrumentation both on the ground (e.g., DKIST,
ALMA) and space-based (e.g., Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter), we aim to
review new insights based on IRIS observations or related modeling, and
highlight some of the outstanding challenges that have been brought to the
fore.",2021-03-30T06:52:05Z

with a convective core has so far been based on homogeneous analyses of space
photometric Kepler light curves of 4 years duration, to which most often
incomplete inhomogeneously deduced spectroscopic information was added to break
degeneracies. We composed a sample of 111 dwarf gravity-mode pulsators observed
by the Kepler space telescope whose light curves allowed for determination of
their near-core rotation rates. For this sample we assembled HERMES
high-resolution optical spectroscopy at the 1.2-m Mercator telescope. Our
spectroscopic information offers additional observational input to also model
the envelope layers of these non-radially pulsating dwarfs. We determined
stellar parameters and surface abundances in a homogeneous way from atmospheric
analysis with spectrum normalisation based on a new machine learning tool. Our
results suggest a systematic overestimation of [M/H] in the literature for the
studied F-type dwarfs, presumably due to normalisation limitations caused by
the dense line spectrum of these rotating stars. CNO-surface abundances were
found to be uncorrelated with the rotation properties of the F-type stars. For
the B-type stars, we find a hint of deep mixing from C and O abundance ratios;
N abundances have too large uncertainties to reveal a correlation with the
rotation of the stars. Our spectroscopic stellar parameters and abundance
determinations allow for future joint spectroscopic, astrometric (Gaia), and
asteroseismic modelling of this legacy sample of gravity-mode pulsators, with
the aim to improve our understanding of transport processes in the
core-hydrogen burning phase of stellar evolution.",2021-04-09T17:59:50Z
"A comparison of the active region upflow and core properties using
  simultaneous spectroscopic observations from IRIS and Hinode","The origin of the slow solar wind is still an open issue. It has been
suggested that upflows at the edge of active regions (AR) can contribute to the
slow solar wind. Here, we compared the upflow region and the AR core and
studied how the plasma properties change from the chromosphere via the
transition region to the corona. We studied limb-to-limb observations NOAA
12687 (14th - 25th Nov 2017). We analysed spectroscopic data simultaneously
obtained from IRIS and Hinode/EIS in six spectral lines. We studied the mutual
relationships between the plasma properties for each emission line, as well as
comparing the plasma properties between the neighbouring formation temperature
lines. To find the most characteristic spectra, we classified the spectra in
each wavelength using the machine learning technique k-means. We found that in
the upflow region the Doppler velocities of the coronal lines are strongly
correlated, but the transition region and coronal lines show no correlation.
However, their fluxes are strongly correlated. The upflow region has lower
density and lower temperature than the AR core. In the upflow region, the
Doppler and non-thermal velocity show a strong correlation in the coronal
lines, but the correlation is not seen in the AR core. At the boundary between
the upflow region and the AR core, the upflow region shows an increase in the
coronal non-thermal velocity, the emission obtained from the DEM, and the
domination of the redshifted regions in the chromosphere. The obtained results
suggest that at least three parallel mechanisms generate the plasma upflow: (1)
the reconnection between closed loops and open magnetic field lines in the
lower corona or upper chromosphere; (2) the reconnection between the
chromospheric small-scale loops and open magnetic field; (3) the expansion of
the magnetic field lines that allows the chromospheric plasma to escape to the
solar corona.",2021-04-20T20:21:35Z
"Flare Forecasting Algorithms Based on High-Gradient Polarity Inversion
  Lines in Active Regions","Solar flares emanate from solar active regions hosting complex and strong
bipolar magnetic fluxes. Estimating the probability of an active region to
flare and defining reliable precursors of intense flares is an extremely
challenging task in the space weather field. In this work, we focus on two
metrics as flare precursors, the unsigned flux R, tested on MDI/SOHO data and
one of the most used parameters for flare forecasting applications, and a novel
topological parameter D representing the complexity of a solar active region.
More in detail, we propose an algorithm for the computation of the R value
which exploits the higher spatial resolution of HMI maps. This algorithm leads
to a differently computed R value, whose functionality is tested on a set of
cycle 24th solar flares. Furthermore, we introduce a topological parameter
based on the automatic recognition of magnetic polarity-inversion lines in
identified active regions, and able to evaluate its magnetic topological
complexity. We use both a heuristic approach and a supervised machine learning
method to validate the effectiveness of these two descriptors to predict the
occurrence of X- or M- class flares in a given solar active region during the
following 24 hours period. Our feature ranking analysis shows that both
parameters play a significant role in prediction performances. Moreover, the
analysis demonstrates that the new topological parameter D is the only one,
among 173 overall predictors, which is always present for all test subsets and
is systematically ranked within the top-ten positions in all tests concerning
the computation of the weighs with which each predictor impacts the flare
forecasting.",2021-05-03T14:32:14Z
"The Flare Likelihood and Region Eruption Forecasting (FLARECAST)
  Project: Flare forecasting in the big data & machine learning era","The EU funded the FLARECAST project, that ran from Jan 2015 until Feb 2018.
FLARECAST had a R2O focus, and introduced several innovations into the
discipline of solar flare forecasting. FLARECAST innovations were: first, the
treatment of hundreds of physical properties viewed as promising flare
predictors on equal footing, extending multiple previous works; second, the use
of fourteen (14) different ML techniques, also on equal footing, to optimize
the immense Big Data parameter space created by these many predictors; third,
the establishment of a robust, three-pronged communication effort oriented
toward policy makers, space-weather stakeholders and the wider public.
FLARECAST pledged to make all its data, codes and infrastructure openly
available worldwide. The combined use of 170+ properties (a total of 209
predictors are now available) in multiple ML algorithms, some of which were
designed exclusively for the project, gave rise to changing sets of
best-performing predictors for the forecasting of different flaring levels. At
the same time, FLARECAST reaffirmed the importance of rigorous training and
testing practices to avoid overly optimistic pre-operational prediction
performance. In addition, the project has (a) tested new and revisited
physically intuitive flare predictors and (b) provided meaningful clues toward
the transition from flares to eruptive flares, namely, events associated with
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). These leads, along with the FLARECAST data,
algorithms and infrastructure, could help facilitate integrated space-weather
forecasting efforts that take steps to avoid effort duplication. In spite of
being one of the most intensive and systematic flare forecasting efforts
to-date, FLARECAST has not managed to convincingly lift the barrier of
stochasticity in solar flare occurrence and forecasting: solar flare prediction
thus remains inherently probabilistic.",2021-05-12T22:34:57Z
"Surface rotation and photometric activity for Kepler targets. II. G and
  F main-sequence stars, and cool subgiant stars","Dark magnetic spots crossing the stellar disc lead to quasi-periodic
brightness variations, which allow us to constrain stellar surface rotation and
photometric activity. The current work is the second of this series (Santos et
al. 2019; Paper I), where we analyze the Kepler long-cadence data of 132,921
main-sequence F and G stars and late subgiant stars. Rotation-period candidates
are obtained by combining wavelet analysis with autocorrelation function.
Reliable rotation periods are then selected via a machine learning (ML)
algorithm (Breton et al. 2021), automatic selection, and complementary visual
inspection. The ML training data set comprises 26,521 main-sequence K and M
stars from Paper I. To supplement the training, we analyze in the same way as
Paper I, i.e. automatic selection and visual inspection, 34,100 additional
stars. We finally provide rotation periods Prot and associated photometric
activity proxy Sph for 39,592 targets. Hotter stars are generally faster
rotators than cooler stars. For main-sequence G stars, Sph spans a wider range
of values with increasing effective temperature, while F stars tend to have
smaller Sph values in comparison with cooler stars. Overall for G stars, fast
rotators are photometrically more active than slow rotators, with Sph
saturating at short periods. The combined outcome of the two papers accounts
for average Prot and Sph values for 55,232 main-sequence and subgiant FGKM
stars (out of 159,442 targets), with 24,182 new Prot detections in comparison
with McQuillan et al. (2014). The upper edge of the Prot distribution is
located at longer Prot than found previously.",2021-07-05T18:36:17Z
"Cataclysmic Variables in the Second Year of the Zwicky Transient
  Facility","Using a filter in the GROWTH Marshal based on color and the amplitude and the
timescale of variability, we have identified 372 objects as known or candidate
cataclysmic variables (CVs) during the second year of operation of the Zwicky
Transient Facility (ZTF). From the available difference imaging data, we found
that 93 are previously confirmed CVs, and 279 are strong candidates. Spectra of
four of the candidates confirm them as CVs by the presence of Balmer emission
lines, while one of the four has prominent HeII lines indicative of containing
a magnetic white dwarf. Gaia EDR3 parallaxes are available for 154 of these
systems, resulting in distances from 108-2096 pc and absolute magnitudes in the
range of 7.5-15.0, with the largest number of candidates between 10.5-12.5. The
total numbers are 21% higher than from the previous year of the survey with a
greater number of distances available but a smaller percentage of systems close
to the Galactic plane. Comparison of these findings with a machine learning
method of searching all the light curves reveals large differences in each
dataset related to the parameters involved in the search process.",2021-07-15T00:04:48Z
"LTD064402+245919: A Subgiant with a 1-3 M$_{\odot}$ Undetected Companion
  Identified from LAMOST-TD Data","Single-line spectroscopic binaries recently contribute to the stellar-mass
black hole discovery, independently of the X-ray transient method. We report
the identification of a single-line binary system LTD064402+245919, with an
orbital period of 14.50 days. The observed component is a subgiant with a mass
of 2.77$\pm$0.68M$_{\odot}$, radius 15.5$\pm$2.5R$_{\odot}$, effective
temperature $T_{\rm eff}$ 4500$\pm$200K, and surface gravity log\emph{g}
2.5$\pm$0.25dex. The discovery makes use of the LAMOST time-domain (LAMOST-TD)
and ZTF survey. Our general-purpose software pipeline applies the Lomb-Scargle
periodogram to determine the orbital period and uses machine-learning to
classify the variable type from the folded light curves. We apply a combined
model to estimate the orbital parameters from both the light and radial
velocity curves, taking constraints on the primary star mass, mass function,
and detection limit of secondary luminosity into consideration. We obtain a
radial velocity semi-amplitude of 44.6$\pm$1.5 km s$^{-1}$, mass ratio of
0.73$\pm$0.07, and an undetected component mass of 2.02$\pm$0.49M$_{\odot}$
when the type of the undetected component is not set. We conclude that the
inclination is not well constrained, and that the secondary mass is larger than
1M$_{\odot}$ when the undetected component is modelled as a compact object.
According to our investigations using an MCMC simulation, increasing the
spectra SNR by a factor of 3 would enable the secondary light to be
distinguished (if present). The algorithm and software in this work are able to
serve as general-purpose tools for the identification of compact objects
quiescent in X-rays.",2021-10-15T08:50:07Z
"Metallicities in M dwarfs: Investigating different determination
  techniques","Deriving metallicities for solar-like stars follows well-established methods,
but for cooler stars such as M dwarfs, the determination is much more
complicated due to forests of molecular lines that are present. Several methods
have been developed in recent years to determine accurate stellar parameters
for these cool stars ($T_{\rm eff} \lesssim$ 4000 K). However, significant
differences can be found at times when comparing metallicities for the same
star derived using different methods. In this work, we determine the effective
temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities of 18 well-studied M dwarfs
observed with the CARMENES high-resolution spectrograph following different
approaches, including synthetic spectral fitting, analysis of pseudo-equivalent
widths, and machine learning. We analyzed the discrepancies in the derived
stellar parameters, including metallicity, in several analysis runs. Our goal
is to minimize these discrepancies and find stellar parameters that are more
consistent with the literature values. We attempted to achieve this consistency
by standardizing the most commonly used components, such as wavelength ranges,
synthetic model spectra, continuum normalization methods, and stellar
parameters. We conclude that although such modifications work quite well for
hotter main-sequence stars, they do not improve the consistency in stellar
parameters for M dwarfs, leading to mean deviations of around 50-200 K in
temperature and 0.1-0.3 dex in metallicity. In particular, M dwarfs are much
more complex and a standardization of the aforementioned components cannot be
considered as a straightforward recipe for bringing consistency to the derived
parameters. Further in-depth investigations of the employed methods would be
necessary in order to identify and correct for the discrepancies that remain.",2021-11-29T20:55:29Z
"Analysis of high-resolution FEROS spectroscopy for a sample of variable
  B-type stars assembled from TESS photometry","Spectroscopic data are necessary to break degeneracies in asteroseismic
modelling of the interior structure in high- and intermediate-mass stars. We
derive precise photospheric stellar parameters for a sample of 166 B-type stars
with TESS light curves, suitable for detailed asteroseismic studies, through a
homogeneous spectroscopic analysis. The variability types of these stars are
classified based on all currently available TESS sectors. We obtained
high-resolution spectra for all 166 targets with the FEROS spectrograph in the
context of a large program. The Least-Squares Deconvolution method is employed
to investigate spectral line profile variability and to detect binary systems.
We identify 26 spectroscopic double-lined binaries; the remainder of the sample
are 42 supergiants in the LMC galaxy and 98 Galactic stars. The spectra of the
Galactic stars are analysed with the zeta-Payne, a machine learning-based
spectrum analysis algorithm. We determine the five main surface parameters with
average formal precisions of 70 K (Teff), 0.03 dex (logg), 0.07 dex ([M/H]), 8
km/s (vsini), and 0.7 km/s (vmicro). The average internal uncertainties we find
for FEROS spectra with our spectrum analysis method are 430 K (Teff), 0.12 dex
(logg), 0.13 dex ([M/H]), 12 km/s (vsini), and 2 km/s (vmicro). We find
spectroscopic evidence that eight of the 98 Galactic targets are fast rotating
g-mode pulsators occurring in between the slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars and
delta Scuti instability strips. The g-mode frequencies of these pulsators are
shifted to relatively high frequency values due to their rotation. Their
apparently too low Teff relative to the SPB instability region can in most
cases be explained by the gravity darkening effect. We also discover 13 new
HgMn stars of which only one is found in a spectroscopic binary, resulting in a
biased and therefore unreliable low binary rate of only 8%.",2022-06-22T18:00:05Z
"Statistical Study of the Correlation between Solar Energetic Particles
  and Properties of Active Regions","The flux of energetic particles originating from the Sun fluctuates during
the solar cycles. It depends on the number and properties of Active Regions
(ARs) present in a single day and associated solar activities, such as solar
flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Observational records of the Space
Weather Prediction Center (SWPC NOAA) enable the creation of time-indexed
databases containing information about ARs and particle flux enhancements, most
widely known as Solar Energetic Particle events (SEPs). In this work, we
utilize the data available for Solar Cycles 21-24, and the initial phase of
Cycle 25 to perform a statistical analysis of the correlation between SEPs and
properties of ARs inferred from the McIntosh and Hale classifications. We find
that the complexity of the magnetic field, longitudinal location, area, and
penumbra type of the largest sunspot of ARs are most correlated with the
production of SEPs. It is found that most SEPs ($\approx$60\%, or 108 out of
181 considered events) were generated from an AR classified with the 'k'
McIntosh subclass as the second component, and these ARs are more likely to
produce SEPs if they fall in a Hale class containing $\delta$ component. The
resulting database containing information about SEP events and ARs is publicly
available and can be used for the development of Machine Learning (ML) models
to predict the occurrence of SEPs.",2023-03-10T17:34:06Z
Uncovering new white dwarf - open cluster associations using Gaia DR3,"Context: Open clusters (OCs) provide homogeneous samples of white dwarfs
(WDs) with known distances, extinctions, and total ages. The unprecedented
astrometric precision of \textit{\textit{Gaia}} allows us to identify many
novel OC--WD pairs. Studying WDs in the context of their parent OCs makes it
possible to determine the properties of WD progenitors and study the
initial-final mass relation (IFMR). Aims: We seek to find potential new WD
members of OCs in the solar vicinity. The analysis of OC members' parallaxes
allows us to determine the OC distances to a high precision, which in turn
enables us to calculate WD masses and cooling ages and to constrain the IFMR.
Methods: We searched for new potential WD members of nearby OCs using the
density-based machine learning clustering algorithm \texttt{HDBSCAN}. The
clustering analysis was applied in five astrometric dimensions -- positions in
the sky, proper motions and parallaxes -- and in three dimensions where the
positional information was not considered in the clustering analysis. The
identified candidate OC WDs were further filtered using the photometric
criteria and properties of their putative host OCs. The masses and cooling ages
of the WDs were calculated via a photometric method using all available
\textit{\textit{Gaia}}, Pan-STARRS, SDSS, and GALEX photometry. The WD
progenitor masses were determined using the ages and metallicities of their
host OCs. Results: Altogether, 63 OC WD candidates were recovered, 27 of which
are already known in the literature. We provide characterization for 36 novel
WDs that have significant OC membership probabilities. Six of them fall into
relatively unconstrained sections of the IFMR where the relation seems to
exhibit nonlinear behavior. We were not able to identify any WDs originating
from massive progenitors that would even remotely approach the widely adopted
WD progenitor mass limit. (abridged)",2023-07-03T20:16:18Z
"Solar Jet Hunter: a citizen science initiative to identify coronal jets
  in EUV data sets","Context. Solar coronal jets seen in EUV are ubiquitous on the Sun, have been
found in and at the edges of active regions, at the boundaries of coronal
holes, and in the quiet Sun. Jets have various shapes, sizes, brightness,
velocities and duration in time, which complicates their detection by automated
algorithms. So far, solar jets reported in the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase
(HEK) have been mostly reported by humans looking for them in the data, with
different levels of precision regarding their timing and positions. Aims. We
create a catalogue of solar jets observed in EUV at 304 {\AA} containing
precise and consistent information on the jet timing, position and extent.
Methods. We designed a citizen science project, ""Solar Jet Hunter"", on the
Zooniverse platform, to analyze EUV observations at 304 {\AA} from the Solar
Dynamic Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA). We created movie
strips for regions of the Sun in which jets have been reported in HEK and ask
the volunteers to 1) confirm the presence of at least one jet in the data and
2) report the timing, position and extent of the jet. Results. We report here
the design of the project and the results obtained after the analysis of data
from 2011 to 2016. 365 ""coronal jet"" events from HEK served as input for the
citizen science project, equivalent to more than 120,000 images distributed
into 9,689 ""movie strips"". Classification by the citizen scientists resulted
with only 21% of the data containing a jet, and 883 individual jets being
identified. Conclusions. We demonstrate how citizen science can enhance the
analysis of solar data with the example of Solar Jet Hunter. The catalogue of
jets thus created is publicly available and will enable statistical studies of
jets and related phenomena. This catalogue will also be used as a training set
for machines to learn to recognize jets in further data sets.",2023-09-26T11:59:58Z
"Flares hunting in hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars from Cycles 1-5 of
  TESS photometry","Stellar flares are critical phenomena on stellar surfaces, which are closely
tied to stellar magnetism. While extensively studied in main-sequence (MS)
stars, their occurrence in evolved compact stars, specifically hot subdwarfs
and white dwarfs (WDs), remains scarcely explored. Based on Cycles 1-5 of TESS
photometry, we conducted a pioneering survey of flare events in $\sim12,000$
compact stars, corresponding to $\sim38,000$ light curves with 2-minute
cadence. Through dedicated techniques for detrending light curves, identifying
preliminary flare candidates, and validating them via machine learning, we
established a catalog of 1016 flares from 193 compact stars, including 182 from
58 sdB/sdO stars and 834 from 135 WDs, respectively. However, all flaring
compact stars showed signs of contamination from nearby objects or companion
stars, preventing sole attribution of the detected flares. For WDs, it is
highly probable that the flares originated from their cool MS companions. In
contrast, the higher luminosities of sdB/sdO stars diminish companion
contributions, suggesting that detected flares originated from sdB/sdO stars
themselves or through close magnetic interactions with companions. Focusing on
a refined sample of 23 flares from 13 sdB/sdO stars, we found their flare
frequency distributions were slightly divergent from those of cool MS stars;
instead, they resemble those of hot B/A-type MS stars having radiative
envelopes. This similarity implies the flares on sdB/sdO stars, if these flares
did originate from them, may share underlying mechanisms with hot MS stars,
which warrants further investigation.",2024-02-25T07:35:02Z
"High-resolution observations of two pores with the integral field unit
  (IFU) of the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS)","The goal is to compare the intricate details of the magnetic and flow fields
around two solar pores, where one is part of an active region and the other is
an isolated pore, with a secondary goal of demonstrating the scientific
capabilities of the GRIS IFU. Two pores were observed with the HiFI and the
GRIS IFU at the GREGOR solar telescope on 29 May and 6 June 2019. The GRIS IFU
mosaics provide spectropolarimetric data for inversions of the Ca I 1083.9 nm
and Si I 1082.7 nm spectral lines, covering the deep and upper photosphere. The
t-SNE machine learning algorithm is employed to identify different classes of
Si I Stokes-V profiles. The LCT technique derives horizontal proper motions
around the pores. Both pores contain a thin light bridge, are stable during the
observations, and never develop a penumbra. The isolated pore is three times
smaller and significantly darker than the active-region pore, which is not
predicted by simulations. The LCT maps show inflows around both pores, with
lower velocities for the isolated pore. Both pores are embedded in the
photospheric LOS velocity pattern of the granulation but filamentary structures
are only visible in the chromospheric LOS maps of the active-region pore. The
t-SNE identifies five clusters of Si I Stokes-V profiles, revealing an
`onion-peel' magnetic field structure, despite the small size of the pores. The
core with strong vertical magnetic fields is surrounded by concentric layers
with lower and more inclined magnetic fields. The active-region pore shows some
signatures of increased interaction between plasma motions and magnetic fields,
which can be considered as early signs of penumbra formation. However, similar
physical properties prevail for smaller pores. A statistically meaningful
sample of different pore sizes and morphologies is required to distinguish
between active-region and isolated pore formation mechanisms.",2024-06-20T13:26:01Z
Solar rotation and activity for cycle 24 from SDO/AIA observations,"The differential rotation plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the Sun. We
study the solar rotation and its correlation with solar activity by applying a
modified machine learning algorithm to identify and track coronal bright points
(CBPs) from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
observations at 193 \AA\ during cycle 24. For more than 321,440 CBPs, the
sidereal and meridional velocities are computed. We find the occurring height
of CBPs about 5627 km above the photosphere. We obtain a rotational map for the
corona by tracking CBPs at the formation height of Fe\,{\sc xii} (193 \AA)
emissions. The equator rotation (14.$^{\circ}$40 to 14.$^{\circ}$54 day$^{-1}$)
and latitudinal gradient of rotation ($ - $3.$^{\circ}$0 to $ - $2.$^{\circ}$64
day$^{-1}$) show very slightly positive and negative trends with solar activity
(sunspots and flares), respectively. For cycle 24, our investigations show that
the northern hemisphere has more differential rotation than the southern
hemisphere, confirmed by the asymmetry of the midlatitude rotation parameter.
The asymmetry (ranked) of the latitudinal gradient of the rotation parameter is
concordant with the sunspot numbers for 7 yr within the 9 yr of the cycle;
however, for only 3 yr, it is concordant with the flare index. The minimum
horizontal Reynolds stress changes from about $ - $2500 m$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$
(corresponding to high activity) in 2012 and 2014 to $ - $100 m$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$
(corresponding to low activity) in 2019 over 5$^{\circ}$ to 35$^{\circ}$
latitudes within cycle 24. We conclude that the negative horizontal Reynolds
stress (momentum transfer toward the Sun's equator) is a helpful indication of
solar activity.",2024-07-24T19:01:47Z
"J-PLUS: Searching for very metal-poor star candidates using the SPEEM
  pipeline","We explore the stellar content of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe
Survey (J-PLUS) Data Release 2 and show its potential to identify
low-metallicity stars using the Stellar Parameters Estimation based on Ensemble
Methods (SPEEM) pipeline. SPEEM is a tool to provide determinations of
atmospheric parameters for stars and separate stellar sources from quasars,
using the unique J-PLUS photometric system. The adoption of adequate selection
criteria allows the identification of metal-poor star candidates suitable for
spectroscopic follow-up. SPEEM consists of a series of machine learning models
which uses a training sample observed by both J-PLUS and the SEGUE
spectroscopic survey. The training sample has temperatures Teff between 4\,800
K and 9\,000 K; $\log g$ between 1.0 and 4.5, and $-3.1<[Fe/H]<+0.5$. The
performance of the pipeline has been tested with a sample of stars observed by
the LAMOST survey within the same parameter range. The average differences
between the parameters of a sample of stars observed with SEGUE and J-PLUS,
which were obtained with the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline and SPEEM,
respectively, are $\Delta Teff\sim 41$ K, $\Delta \log g\sim 0.11$ dex, and
$\Delta [Fe/H]\sim 0.09$ dex. A sample of 177 stars have been identified as new
candidates with $[Fe/H]<-2.5$ and 11 of them have been observed with the ISIS
spectrograph at the William Herschel Telescope. The spectroscopic analysis
confirms that $64\%$ of stars have $[Fe/H]<-2.5$, including one new star with
$[Fe/H]<-3.0$. SPEEM in combination with the J-PLUS filter system has shown the
potential to estimate the stellar atmospheric parameters (Teff, $\log g$, and
[Fe/H]). The spectroscopic validation of the candidates shows that SPEEM yields
a success rate of $64\%$ on the identification of very metal-poor star
candidates with $[Fe/H]<-2.5$.",2021-09-23T19:06:04Z
"Machine learning as a flaring storm warning machine: Was a warning
  machine for the September 2017 solar flaring storm possible?","Machine learning is nowadays the methodology of choice for flare forecasting
and supervised techniques, in both their traditional and deep versions, are
becoming the most frequently used ones for prediction in this area of space
weather. Yet, machine learning has not been able so far to realize an operating
warning system for flaring storms and the scientific literature of the last
decade suggests that its performances in the prediction of intense solar flares
are not optimal.
  The main difficulties related to forecasting solar flaring storms are
probably two. First, most methods are conceived to provide probabilistic
predictions and not to send binary yes/no indications on the consecutive
occurrence of flares along an extended time range. Second, flaring storms are
typically characterized by the explosion of high energy events, which are
seldom recorded in the databases of space missions; as a consequence,
supervised methods are trained on very imbalanced historical sets, which makes
them particularly ineffective for the forecasting of intense flares.
  Yet, in this study we show that supervised machine learning could be utilized
in a way to send timely warnings about the most violent and most unexpected
flaring event of the last decade, and even to predict with some accuracy the
energy budget daily released by magnetic reconnection during the whole time
course of the storm. Further, we show that the combination of
sparsity-enhancing machine learning and feature ranking could allow the
identification of the prominent role that energy played as an Active Region
property in the forecasting process.",2020-07-05T19:03:54Z
Supervised Neural Networks for Helioseismic Ring-Diagram Inversions,"The inversion of ring fit parameters to obtain subsurface flow maps in
ring-diagram analysis for 8 years of SDO observations is computationally
expensive, requiring ~3200 CPU hours. In this paper we apply machine learning
techniques to the inversion in order to speed up calculations. Specifically, we
train a predictor for subsurface flows using the mode fit parameters and the
previous inversion results, to replace future inversion requirements. We
utilize Artificial Neural Networks as a supervised learning method for
predicting the flows in 15 degree ring tiles. To demonstrate that the machine
learning results still contain the subtle signatures key to local helioseismic
studies, we use the machine learning results to study the recently discovered
solar equatorial Rossby waves. The Artificial Neural Network is computationally
efficient, able to make future flow predictions of an entire Carrington
rotation in a matter of seconds, which is much faster than the current ~31 CPU
hours. Initial training of the networks requires ~3 CPU hours. The trained
Artificial Neural Network can achieve a root mean-square error equal to
approximately half that reported for the velocity inversions, demonstrating the
accuracy of the machine learning (and perhaps the overestimation of the
original errors from the ring-diagram pipeline). We find the signature of
equatorial Rossby waves in the machine learning flows covering six years of
data, demonstrating that small-amplitude signals are maintained. The recovery
of Rossby waves in the machine learning flow maps can be achieved with only one
Carrington rotation (27.275 days) of training data. We have shown that machine
learning can be applied to, and perform more efficiently than the current
ring-diagram inversion. The computation burden of the machine learning includes
3 CPU hours for initial training, then around 0.0001 CPU hours for future

Predicting the Emergence of Solar Active Regions Using Machine Learning,"To create early warning capabilities for upcoming Space Weather disturbances,
we have selected a dataset of 61 emerging active regions, which allows us to
identify characteristic features in the evolution of acoustic power density to
predict continuum intensity emergence. For our study, we have utilized Doppler
shift and continuum intensity observations from the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The local tracking
of 30.66 x 30.66-degree patches in the vicinity of active regions allowed us to
trace the evolution of active regions starting from the pre-emergence state. We
have developed a machine learning model to capture the acoustic power flux
density variations associated with upcoming magnetic flux emergence. The
trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is able to predict 5 hours ahead
whether, in a given area of the solar surface, continuum intensity values will
decrease. The performed study allows us to investigate the potential of the
machine learning approach to predict the emergence of active regions using
acoustic power maps as input.",2024-02-14T01:41:50Z
Predicting Solar Flares with Remote Sensing and Machine Learning,"High energy solar flares and coronal mass ejections have the potential to
destroy Earth's ground and satellite infrastructures, causing trillions of
dollars in damage and mass human suffering. Destruction of these critical
systems would disable power grids and satellites, crippling communications and
transportation. This would lead to food shortages and an inability to respond
to emergencies. A solution to this impending problem is proposed herein using
satellites in solar orbit that continuously monitor the Sun, use artificial
intelligence and machine learning to calculate the probability of massive solar
explosions from this sensed data, and then signal defense mechanisms that will
mitigate the threat. With modern technology there may be only safeguards that
can be implemented with enough warning, which is why the best algorithm must be
identified and continuously trained with existing and new data to maximize true
positive rates while minimizing false negatives. This paper conducts a survey
of current machine learning models using open source solar flare prediction
data. The rise of edge computing allows machine learning hardware to be placed
on the same satellites as the sensor arrays, saving critical time by not having
to transmit remote sensing data across the vast distances of space. A system of
systems approach will allow enough warning for safety measures to be put into
place mitigating the risk of disaster.",2021-10-14T18:28:28Z
Predicting Stellar Rotation Periods Using XGBoost,"This work aims to develop a computationally inexpensive approach, based on
machine learning techniques, to accurately predict thousands of stellar
rotation periods. The innovation in our approach is the use of the XGBoost
algorithm to predict the rotation periods of Kepler targets by means of
regression analysis. Therefore, we focused on building a robust supervised
machine learning model to predict surface stellar rotation periods from
structured data sets built from the Kepler catalogue of K and M stars. We
analysed the set of independent variables extracted from Kepler light curves
and investigated the relationships between them and the ground truth. Using the
extreme gradient boosting method, we obtained a minimal set of variables that
can be used to build machine learning models for predicting stellar rotation
periods. Our models are validated by predicting the rotation periods of about
2900 stars. The results are compatible with those obtained by classical
techniques and comparable to those obtained by other recent machine learning
approaches, with the advantage of using much fewer predictors. Restricting the
analysis to stars with rotation periods of less than 45 days, our models are on
average 96 % correct. We have developed an innovative approach, based on a
machine learning method, to accurately fit the rotation periods of stars. Based
on the results of this study, we conclude that the best models generated by the
proposed methodology are competitive with the state-of-the-art approaches, with
the advantage of being computationally cheaper, easy to train, and relying on
small sets of predictors.",2023-05-03T20:01:15Z
Predicting the Geoeffectiveness of CMEs Using Machine Learning,"Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most geoeffective space weather
phenomena, being associated with large geomagnetic storms, having the potential
to cause disturbances to telecommunication, satellite network disruptions,
power grid damages and failures. Thus, considering these storms' potential
effects on human activities, accurate forecasts of the geoeffectiveness of CMEs
are paramount. This work focuses on experimenting with different machine
learning methods trained on white-light coronagraph datasets of close to sun
CMEs, to estimate whether such a newly erupting ejection has the potential to
induce geomagnetic activity. We developed binary classification models using
logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, feed forward
artificial neural networks, as well as ensemble models. At this time, we
limited our forecast to exclusively use solar onset parameters, to ensure
extended warning times. We discuss the main challenges of this task, namely the
extreme imbalance between the number of geoeffective and ineffective events in
our dataset, along with their numerous similarities and the limited number of
available variables. We show that even in such conditions, adequate hit rates
can be achieved with these models.",2022-06-23T03:56:22Z
General classification of light curves using extreme boosting,"A significant degree of misclassification of variable stars through the
application of machine learning methods to survey data motivates a search for
more reliable and accurate machine learning procedures, especially in light of
the very large data cubes that will be generated by future surveys and the need
for immediate production of accurate, formalised catalogues of variable
behaviour to enable science to proceed. In this study, the efficiency of an
ensemble machine learning procedure utilising extreme boosting was determined
by application to a large sample of data from the OGLE III and IV surveys and
from the \textit{Kepler} mission. Through recursive training of classifiers,
the study developed a variable star classification workflow which produced an
average efficiency determined with the average precision of the model (0.81 for
\textit{Kepler} and 0.91 for OGLE) and the $f-score$ of predictions on the test
sets. This suggests that extreme boosting can be presented as one of the
favourable shallow learning methods in developing a variable star classifier
for future large survey projects.",2019-06-15T23:57:44Z
"Solar Flare Index Prediction Using SDO/HMI Vector Magnetic Data Products
  with Statistical and Machine Learning Methods","Solar flares, especially the M- and X-class flares, are often associated with
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). They are the most important sources of space
weather effects, that can severely impact the near-Earth environment. Thus it
is essential to forecast flares (especially the M-and X-class ones) to mitigate
their destructive and hazardous consequences. Here, we introduce several
statistical and Machine Learning approaches to the prediction of the AR's Flare
Index (FI) that quantifies the flare productivity of an AR by taking into
account the numbers of different class flares within a certain time interval.
Specifically, our sample includes 563 ARs appeared on solar disk from May 2010
to Dec 2017. The 25 magnetic parameters, provided by the Space-weather HMI
Active Region Patches (SHARP) from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on
board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), characterize coronal magnetic
energy stored in ARs by proxy and are used as the predictors. We investigate
the relationship between these SHARP parameters and the FI of ARs with a
machine-learning algorithm (spline regression) and the resampling method
(Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique for Regression with Gaussian Noise,
short by SMOGN). Based on the established relationship, we are able to predict
the value of FIs for a given AR within the next 1-day period. Compared with
other 4 popular machine learning algorithms, our methods improve the accuracy
of FI prediction, especially for large FI. In addition, we sort the importance
of SHARP parameters by Borda Count method calculated from the ranks that are
rendered by 9 different machine learning methods.",2022-09-28T02:13:33Z
Unsupervised Learning for Stellar Spectra with Deep Normalizing Flows,"Stellar spectra encode detailed information about the stars. However, most
machine learning approaches in stellar spectroscopy focus on supervised
learning. We introduce Mendis, an unsupervised learning method, which adopts
normalizing flows consisting of Neural Spline Flows and GLOW to describe the
complex distribution of spectral space. A key advantage of Mendis is that we
can describe the conditional distribution of spectra, conditioning on stellar
parameters, to unveil the underlying structures of the spectra further. In
particular, our study demonstrates that Mendis can robustly capture the pixel
correlations in the spectra leading to the possibility of detecting unknown
atomic transitions from stellar spectra. The probabilistic nature of Mendis
also enables a rigorous determination of outliers in extensive spectroscopic
surveys without the need to measure elemental abundances through existing
analysis pipelines beforehand.",2022-07-06T16:22:33Z
"Machine Learning Refinements to Metallicity-Dependent Isotopic
  Abundances","The project aims to use machine learning algorithms to fit the free
parameters of an isotopic scaling model to elemental observations. The
processes considered are massive star nucleosynthesis, Type Ia SNe, the
s-process, the r-process, and p-isotope production. The analysis on the
successful fits seeks to minimize the reduced chi squared between the model and
the data. Based upon the successful refinement of the isotopic parameterized
scaling model, a table providing the 287 stable isotopic abundances as a
function of metallicity, separated into astrophysical processes, is useful for
identifying the chemical history of them. The table provides a complete
averaged chemical history for the Galaxy, subject to the underlying model
constraints.",2024-03-05T06:06:22Z
"Machine Learning Approaches to Solar-Flare Forecasting: Is Complex
  Better?","Recently, there has been growing interest in the use of machine-learning
methods for predicting solar flares. Initial efforts along these lines employed
comparatively simple models, correlating features extracted from observations
of sunspot active regions with known instances of flaring. Typically, these
models have used physics-inspired features that have been carefully chosen by
experts in order to capture the salient features of such magnetic field
structures. Over time, the sophistication and complexity of the models involved
has grown. However, there has been little evolution in the choice of feature
sets, nor any systematic study of whether the additional model complexity is
truly useful. Our goal is to address these issues. To that end, we compare the
relative prediction performance of machine-learning-based, flare-forecasting
models with varying degrees of complexity. We also revisit the feature set
design, using topological data analysis to extract shape-based features from
magnetic field images of the active regions. Using hyperparameter training for
fair comparison of different machine-learning models across different feature
sets, we show that simpler models with fewer free parameters \textit{generally
perform better than more-complicated models}, ie., powerful machinery does not
necessarily guarantee better prediction performance. Secondly, we find that
\textit{abstract, shape-based features contain just as much useful
information}, for the purposes of flare prediction, as the set of hand-crafted
features developed by the solar-physics community over the years. Finally, we
study the effects of dimensionality reduction, using principal component
analysis, to show that streamlined feature sets, overall, perform just as well
as the corresponding full-dimensional versions.",2022-02-17T17:28:56Z
"Applications of Machine Learning to Predicting Core-collapse Supernova
  Explosion Outcomes","Most existing criteria derived from progenitor properties of core-collapse
supernovae are not very accurate in predicting explosion outcomes. We present a
novel look at identifying the explosion outcome of core-collapse supernovae
using a machine learning approach. Informed by a sample of 100 2D axisymmetric
supernova simulations evolved with Fornax, we train and evaluate a random
forest classifier as an explosion predictor. Furthermore, we examine
physics-based feature sets including the compactness parameter, the Ertl
condition, and a newly developed set that characterizes the silicon/oxygen
interface. With over 1500 supernovae progenitors from 9$-$27 M$_{\odot}$, we
additionally train an auto-encoder to extract physics-agnostic features
directly from the progenitor density profiles. We find that the density
profiles alone contain meaningful information regarding their explodability.
Both the silicon/oxygen and auto-encoder features predict explosion outcome
with $\approx$90\% accuracy. In anticipation of much larger multi-dimensional
simulation sets, we identify future directions in which machine learning
applications will be useful beyond explosion outcome prediction.",2022-08-02T18:00:05Z
Incorporating Polar Field Data for Improved Solar Flare Prediction,"In this paper, we consider incorporating data associated with the sun's north
and south polar field strengths to improve solar flare prediction performance
using machine learning models. When used to supplement local data from active
regions on the photospheric magnetic field of the sun, the polar field data
provides global information to the predictor. While such global features have
been previously proposed for predicting the next solar cycle's intensity, in
this paper we propose using them to help classify individual solar flares. We
conduct experiments using HMI data employing four different machine learning
algorithms that can exploit polar field information. Additionally, we propose a
novel probabilistic mixture of experts model that can simply and effectively
incorporate polar field data and provide on-par prediction performance with
state-of-the-art solar flare prediction algorithms such as the Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN). Our experimental results indicate the usefulness of the polar
field data for solar flare prediction, which can improve Heidke Skill Score
(HSS2) by as much as 10.1%.",2022-12-04T03:06:11Z
"Quadruple-star systems are not always nested triples: a machine learning
  approach to dynamical stability","The dynamical stability of quadruple-star systems has traditionally been
treated as a problem involving two `nested' triples which constitute a
quadruple. In this novel study, we employed a machine learning algorithm, the
multi-layer perceptron (MLP), to directly classify 2+2 and 3+1 quadruples based
on their stability (or long-term boundedness). The training data sets for the
classification, comprised of $5\times10^5$ quadruples each, were integrated
using the highly accurate direct $N$-body code MSTAR. We also carried out a
limited parameter space study of zero-inclination systems to directly compare
quadruples to triples. We found that both our quadruple MLP models perform
better than a `nested' triple MLP approach, which is especially significant for
3+1 quadruples. The classification accuracies for the 2+2 MLP and 3+1 MLP
models are 94% and 93% respectively, while the scores for the `nested' triple
approach are 88% and 66% respectively. This is a crucial implication for
quadruple population synthesis studies. Our MLP models, which are very simple
and almost instantaneous to implement, are available on GitHub, along with
Python3 scripts to access them.",2023-01-24T11:27:17Z
"Predicting Physical Parameters of Cepheid and RR Lyrae variables in an
  Instant with Machine Learning","We present a machine learning method to estimate the physical parameters of
classical pulsating stars such as RR Lyrae and Cepheid variables based on an
automated comparison of their theoretical and observed light curve parameters
at multiple wavelengths. We train artificial neural networks (ANNs) on
theoretical pulsation models to predict the fundamental parameters (mass,
radius, luminosity, and effective temperature) of Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars
based on their period and light curve parameters. The fundamental parameters of
these stars can be estimated up to 60 percent more accurately when the light
curve parameters are taken into consideration. This method was applied to the
observations of hundreds of Cepheids and thousands of RR Lyrae in the
Magellanic Clouds to produce catalogs of estimated masses, radii, luminosities,
and other parameters of these stars.",2023-03-23T22:05:58Z
"Spectral identification and classification of dusty stellar sources
  using spectroscopic and multiwavelength observations through machine learning","We proposed a machine learning approach to identify and distinguish dusty
stellar sources employing supervised and unsupervised methods and categorizing
point sources, mainly evolved stars, using photometric and spectroscopic data
collected over the IR sky. Spectroscopic data is typically used to identify
specific infrared sources. However, our goal is to determine how well these
sources can be identified using multiwavelength data. Consequently, we
developed a robust training set of spectra of confirmed sources from the Large
and Small Magellanic Clouds derived from SAGE-Spec Spitzer Legacy and SMC-Spec
Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) spectral catalogs. Subsequently, we applied
various learning classifiers to distinguish stellar subcategories comprising
young stellar objects (YSOs), C-rich asymptotic giant branch (CAGB), O-rich AGB
stars (OAGB), Red supergiant (RSG), and post-AGB stars. We have classified
around 700 counts of these sources. It should be highlighted that despite
utilizing the limited spectroscopic data we trained, the accuracy and models'
learning curve provided outstanding results for some of the models. Therefore,
the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is the most accurate classifier for this
limited dataset.",2022-11-07T10:07:37Z
Identifying and Tracking Solar Magnetic Flux Elements with Deep Learning,"Deep learning has drawn a lot of interest in recent years due to its
effectiveness in processing big and complex observational data gathered from
diverse instruments. Here we propose a new deep learning method, called
SolarUnet, to identify and track solar magnetic flux elements or features in
observed vector magnetograms based on the Southwest Automatic Magnetic
Identification Suite (SWAMIS). Our method consists of a data pre-processing
component that prepares training data from the SWAMIS tool, a deep learning
model implemented as a U-shaped convolutional neural network for fast and
accurate image segmentation, and a post-processing component that prepares
tracking results. SolarUnet is applied to data from the 1.6 meter Goode Solar
Telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory. When compared to the widely used
SWAMIS tool, SolarUnet is faster while agreeing mostly with SWAMIS on feature
size and flux distributions, and complementing SWAMIS in tracking long-lifetime
features. Thus, the proposed physics-guided deep learning-based tool can be
considered as an alternative method for solar magnetic tracking.",2020-08-27T12:23:18Z
"Inferring Vector Magnetic Fields from Stokes Profiles of GST/NIRIS Using
  a Convolutional Neural Network","We propose a new machine learning approach to Stokes inversion based on a
convolutional neural network (CNN) and the Milne-Eddington (ME) method. The
Stokes measurements used in this study were taken by the Near InfraRed Imaging
Spectropolarimeter (NIRIS) on the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at the Big
Bear Solar Observatory. By learning the latent patterns in the training data
prepared by the physics-based ME tool, the proposed CNN method is able to infer
vector magnetic fields from the Stokes profiles of GST/NIRIS. Experimental
results show that our CNN method produces smoother and cleaner magnetic maps
than the widely used ME method. Furthermore, the CNN method is 4~6 times faster
than the ME method, and is able to produce vector magnetic fields in near
real-time, which is essential to space weather forecasting. Specifically, it
takes ~50 seconds for the CNN method to process an image of 720 x 720 pixels
comprising Stokes profiles of GST/NIRIS. Finally, the CNN-inferred results are
highly correlated to the ME-calculated results and are closer to the ME's
results with the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC) being
closer to 1 on average than those from other machine learning algorithms such
as multiple support vector regression and multilayer perceptrons (MLP). In
particular, the CNN method outperforms the current best machine learning method
(MLP) by 2.6% on average in PPMCC according to our experimental study. Thus,
the proposed physics-assisted deep learning-based CNN tool can be considered as
an alternative, efficient method for Stokes inversion for high resolution
polarimetric observations obtained by GST/NIRIS.",2020-05-08T10:26:12Z
Machine learning search for variable stars,"Photometric variability detection is often considered as a hypothesis testing
problem: an object is variable if the null-hypothesis that its brightness is
constant can be ruled out given the measurements and their uncertainties.
Uncorrected systematic errors limit the practical applicability of this
approach to high-amplitude variability and well-behaving data sets. Searching
for a new variability detection technique that would be applicable to a wide
range of variability types while being robust to outliers and underestimated
measurement uncertainties, we propose to consider variability detection as a
classification problem that can be approached with machine learning. We compare
several classification algorithms: Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector
Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Neural Nets (NN), Random Forests (RF)
and Stochastic Gradient Boosting classifier (SGB) applied to 18 features
(variability indices) quantifying scatter and/or correlation between points in
a light curve. We use a subset of OGLE-II Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)
photometry (30265 light curves) that was searched for variability using
traditional methods (168 known variable objects identified) as the training set
and then apply the NN to a new test set of 31798 OGLE-II LMC light curves.
Among 205 candidates selected in the test set, 178 are real variables, 13
low-amplitude variables are new discoveries. We find that the considered
machine learning classifiers are more efficient (they find more variables and
less false candidates) compared to traditional techniques that consider
individual variability indices or their linear combination. The NN, SGB, SVM
and RF show a higher efficiency compared to LR and kNN.",2017-10-19T18:00:01Z
"Searching for Barium Stars from the LAMOST Spectra Using the Machine
  Learning Method: I","Barium stars are chemically peculiar stars that exhibit enhancement of
s-process elements. Chemical abundance analysis of barium stars can provide
crucial clues for the study of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. The Large
Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) has released more
than 6 million low-resolution spectra of FGK-type stars by Data Release 9
(DR9), which can significantly increase the sample size of barium stars. In
this paper, we used machine learning algorithms to search for barium stars from
low-resolution spectra of LAMOST. We have applied the Light Gradient Boosting
Machine (LGBM) algorithm to build classifiers of barium stars based on
different features, and build predictors for determining [Ba/Fe] and [Sr/Fe] of
barium candidates. The classification with features in the whole spectrum
performs best: for the sample with strontium enhancement, Precision = 97.81%,
and Recall = 96.05%; for the sample with barium enhancement, Precision = 96.03%
and Recall = 97.70%. In prediction, [Ba/Fe] estimated from BaII line at 4554
\r{A} has smaller dispersion than that from BaII line at 4934 \r{A}: MAE$_{4554
\r{A}}$ = 0.07, $\sigma_{4554 \r{A}}$ = 0.12. [Sr/Fe] estimated from SrII line
at 4077 \r{A} performs better than that from SrII line at 4215 \r{A}:
MAE$_{4077 \r{A}}$ = 0.09, $\sigma_{4077 \r{A}}$ = 0.16. A comparison of the
LGBM and other popular algorithms shows that LGBM is accurate and efficient in
classifying barium stars. This work demonstrated that machine learning can be
used as an effective means to identify chemically peculiar stars and determine
their elemental abundance.",2022-11-13T01:07:17Z
"RotNet: Fast and Scalable Estimation of Stellar Rotation Periods Using
  Convolutional Neural Networks","Magnetic activity in stars manifests as dark spots on their surfaces that
modulate the brightness observed by telescopes. These light curves contain
important information on stellar rotation. However, the accurate estimation of
rotation periods is computationally expensive due to scarce ground truth
information, noisy data, and large parameter spaces that lead to degenerate
solutions. We harness the power of deep learning and successfully apply
Convolutional Neural Networks to regress stellar rotation periods from Kepler
light curves. Geometry-preserving time-series to image transformations of the
light curves serve as inputs to a ResNet-18 based architecture which is trained
through transfer learning. The McQuillan catalog of published rotation periods
is used as ansatz to groundtruth. We benchmark the performance of our method
against a random forest regressor, a 1D CNN, and the Auto-Correlation Function
(ACF) - the current standard to estimate rotation periods. Despite limiting our
input to fewer data points (1k), our model yields more accurate results and
runs 350 times faster than ACF runs on the same number of data points and
10,000 times faster than ACF runs on 65k data points. With only minimal feature
engineering our approach has impressive accuracy, motivating the application of
deep learning to regress stellar parameters on an even larger scale",2020-12-02T07:14:11Z
"An Interpretable Machine Learning Framework for Modeling High-Resolution
  Spectroscopic Data","Comparison of echelle spectra to synthetic models has become a computational
statistics challenge, with over ten thousand individual spectral lines
affecting a typical cool star echelle spectrum. Telluric artifacts, imperfect
line lists, inexact continuum placement, and inflexible models frustrate the
scientific promise of these information-rich datasets. Here we debut an
interpretable machine-learning framework ""blas\'e"" that addresses these and
other challenges. The semi-empirical approach can be viewed as ""transfer
learning"" -- first pre-training models on noise-free precomputed synthetic
spectral models, then learning the corrections to line depths and widths from
whole-spectrum fitting to an observed spectrum. The auto-differentiable model
employs back-propagation, the fundamental algorithm empowering modern Deep
Learning and Neural Networks. Here, however, the 40,000+ parameters symbolize
physically interpretable line profile properties such as amplitude, width,
location, and shape, plus radial velocity and rotational broadening. This
hybrid data-/model- driven framework allows joint modeling of stellar and
telluric lines simultaneously, a potentially transformative step forwards for
mitigating the deleterious telluric contamination in the near-infrared. The
blas\'e approach acts as both a deconvolution tool and semi-empirical model.
The general purpose scaffolding may be extensible to many scientific
applications, including precision radial velocities, Doppler imaging, chemical
abundances, and remote sensing. Its sparse-matrix architecture and
GPU-acceleration make blas\'e fast. The open-source PyTorch-based code includes
tutorials, Application Programming Interface (API) documentation, and more. We
show how the tool fits into the existing Python spectroscopy ecosystem,
demonstrate a range of astrophysical applications, and discuss limitations and
future extensions.",2022-10-04T18:00:49Z
"Towards Interpretable Solar Flare Prediction with Attention-based Deep
  Neural Networks","Solar flare prediction is a central problem in space weather forecasting and
recent developments in machine learning and deep learning accelerated the
adoption of complex models for data-driven solar flare forecasting. In this
work, we developed an attention-based deep learning model as an improvement
over the standard convolutional neural network (CNN) pipeline to perform
full-disk binary flare predictions for the occurrence of $\geq$M1.0-class
flares within the next 24 hours. For this task, we collected compressed images
created from full-disk line-of-sight (LoS) magnetograms. We used data-augmented
oversampling to address the class imbalance issue and used true skill statistic
(TSS) and Heidke skill score (HSS) as the evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we
interpreted our model by overlaying attention maps on input magnetograms and
visualized the important regions focused on by the model that led to the
eventual decision. The significant findings of this study are: (i) We
successfully implemented an attention-based full-disk flare predictor ready for
operational forecasting where the candidate model achieves an average
TSS=0.54$\pm$0.03 and HSS=0.37$\pm$0.07. (ii) we demonstrated that our
full-disk model can learn conspicuous features corresponding to active regions
from full-disk magnetogram images, and (iii) our experimental evaluation
suggests that our model can predict near-limb flares with adept skill and the
predictions are based on relevant active regions (ARs) or AR characteristics
from full-disk magnetograms.",2023-09-08T19:21:10Z
"Single-Frame Super-Resolution of Solar Magnetograms: Investigating
  Physics-Based Metrics \& Losses","Breakthroughs in our understanding of physical phenomena have traditionally
followed improvements in instrumentation. Studies of the magnetic field of the
Sun, and its influence on the solar dynamo and space weather events, have
benefited from improvements in resolution and measurement frequency of new
instruments. However, in order to fully understand the solar cycle,
high-quality data across time-scales longer than the typical lifespan of a
solar instrument are required. At the moment, discrepancies between measurement
surveys prevent the combined use of all available data. In this work, we show
that machine learning can help bridge the gap between measurement surveys by
learning to \textbf{super-resolve} low-resolution magnetic field images and
\textbf{translate} between characteristics of contemporary instruments in
orbit. We also introduce the notion of physics-based metrics and losses for
super-resolution to preserve underlying physics and constrain the solution
space of possible super-resolution outputs.",2019-11-04T21:16:20Z
Shape-based Feature Engineering for Solar Flare Prediction,"Solar flares are caused by magnetic eruptions in active regions (ARs) on the
surface of the sun. These events can have significant impacts on human
activity, many of which can be mitigated with enough advance warning from good
forecasts. To date, machine learning-based flare-prediction methods have
employed physics-based attributes of the AR images as features; more recently,
there has been some work that uses features deduced automatically by deep
learning methods (such as convolutional neural networks). We describe a suite
of novel shape-based features extracted from magnetogram images of the Sun
using the tools of computational topology and computational geometry. We
evaluate these features in the context of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural
network and compare their performance against the traditional physics-based
attributes. We show that these abstract shape-based features outperform the
features chosen by the human experts, and that a combination of the two feature
sets improves the forecasting capability even further.",2020-12-28T18:37:01Z
"Optimized sampling of SDSS-IV MaStar spectra for stellar classification
  using supervised models","Supervised machine learning models are increasingly being used for solving
the problem of stellar classification of spectroscopic data. However, training
such models requires a large number of labelled instances, the collection of
which is usually costly in both time and expertise. Active learning algorithms
minimize training dataset sizes by keeping only the most informative instances.
This paper explores the application of active learning to sampling stellar
spectra using data from a highly class-imbalanced dataset. We utilize the
MaStar library from the SDSS DR17 along with its associated stellar parameter
catalogue. A preprocessing pipeline that includes feature selection, scaling,
and dimensionality reduction is applied to the data. Using different active
learning algorithms, we iteratively query instances, where the model or
committee of models exhibits the highest uncertainty or disagreement,
respectively. We assess the effectiveness of the sampling techniques by
comparing several performance metrics of supervised-learning models trained on
the queried samples with randomly-sampled counterparts. Evaluation metrics
include specificity, sensitivity, and the area under the curve; in addition to
the Matthew's correlation coefficient, which accounts for class imbalance. We
apply this procedure to effective temperature, surface gravity, and iron
metallicity, separately. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of active
learning algorithms in selecting samples that produce performance metrics
superior to random sampling and even stratified samples, with fewer training
instances. Active learning is recommended for prioritizing instance labelling
of astronomical-survey data by experts or crowdsourcing to mitigate the high
time cost. Its effectiveness can be further exploited in selection of targets
for follow-up observations in automated astronomical surveys.",2024-06-26T14:08:39Z
"Machine Learning Regression of extinction in the second $Gaia$ Data
  Release","Machine learning has become a popular tool to help us make better decisions
and predictions, based on experiences, observations and analysing patterns
within a given data set without explicitly functions. In this paper, we
describe an application of the supervised machine-learning algorithm to the
extinction regression for the second Gaia data release, based on the
combination of Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, Sloan
Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration and the Apache Point
Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment. The derived extinction in our
training sample is consistent with other spectrum-based estimates, and its
standard deviation of the cross validations is 0.0127 mag. A blind test is
carried out using the RAdial Velocity Experiment catalog, and the standard
deviation is 0.0372 mag. Such precise training sample enable us to regress the
extinction, E(BP-RP), for 133 million stars in the second Gaia data release. Of
these, 106 million stars have the uncertainties less than 0.1 mag, which suffer
less bias from the external regression. We also find that there are high
deviations between the extinctions form photometry-based methods, and between
spectrum- and photometry-based methods. This implies that spectrum-based method
could bring more signal to a regressing model than multi-band photometry, and a
higher signal-to-noise ratio would acquire a more reliable result.",2019-12-18T02:11:12Z
"Machine Learning Regression of stellar effective temperatures in the
  second $Gaia$ Data Release","This paper reports on the application of the supervised machine-learning
algorithm to the stellar effective temperature regression for the second $Gaia$
data release, based on the combination of the stars in four spectroscopic
surveys: Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, Sloan
Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration, the Apache Point
Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment and the RAdial Velocity Extension.
This combination, about four million stars, enables us to construct one of the
largest training sample for the regression, and further predict reliable
stellar temperatures with a root-mean-squared error of 191 K. This result is
more precise than that given by $Gaia$ second data release that is based on
about sixty thousands stars. After a series of data cleaning processes, the
input features that feed the regressor are carefully selected from the $Gaia$
parameters, including the colors, the 3D position and the proper motion. These
$Gaia$ parameters is used to predict effective temperatures for 132,739,323
valid stars in the second $Gaia$ data release. We also present a new method for
blind tests and a test for external regression without additional data. The
machine-learning algorithm fed with the parameters only in one catalog provides
us an effective approach to maximize sample size for prediction, and this
methodology has a wide application prospect in future studies of astrophysics.",2019-06-24T03:00:01Z
Stellar Spectral Interpolation using Machine Learning,"Theoretical stellar spectra rely on model stellar atmospheres computed based
on our understanding of the physical laws at play in the stellar interiors.
These models, coupled with atomic and molecular line databases, are used to
generate theoretical stellar spectral libraries (SSLs) comprising of stellar
spectra over a regular grid of atmospheric parameters (temperature, surface
gravity, abundances) at any desired resolution. Another class of SSLs is
referred to as empirical spectral libraries; these contain observed spectra at
limited resolution. SSLs play an essential role in deriving the properties of
stars and stellar populations. Both theoretical and empirical libraries suffer
from limited coverage over the parameter space. This limitation is overcome to
some extent by generating spectra for specific sets of atmospheric parameters
by interpolating within the grid of available parameter space. In this work, we
present a method for spectral interpolation in the optical region using machine
learning algorithms that are generic, easily adaptable for any SSL without much
change in the model parameters, and computationally inexpensive. We use two
machine learning techniques, Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Networks
(ANN), and train the models on the MILES library. We apply the trained models
to spectra from the CFLIB for testing and show that the performance of the two
models is comparable. We show that both the models achieve better accuracy than
the existing methods of polynomial based interpolation and the Gaussian radial
basis function (RBF) interpolation.",2020-06-20T01:48:35Z
"Citizen ASAS-SN Data Release I: Variable Star Classification Using
  Citizen Science","We present the first results from Citizen ASAS-SN, a citizen science project
for the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) hosted on the
Zooniverse platform. Citizen ASAS-SN utilizes the newer, deeper, higher cadence
ASAS-SN $g$-band data and tasks volunteers to classify periodic variable star
candidates based on their phased light curves. We started from 40,640 new
variable candidates from an input list of ${\sim} 7.4$ million stars with
$\delta < -60^\circ$ and the volunteers identified 10,420 new discoveries which
they classified as 4,234 pulsating variables, 3,132 rotational variables, 2,923
eclipsing binaries, and 131 variables flagged as Unknown. They classified known
variable stars with an accuracy of 89% for pulsating variables, 81% for
eclipsing binaries, and 49% for rotational variables. We examine user
performance, agreement between users, and compare the citizen science
classifications with our machine learning classifier updated for the $g$-band
light curves. In general, user activity correlates with higher classification
accuracy and higher user agreement. We used the user's ""Junk"" classifications
to develop an effective machine learning classifier to separate real from false
variables, and there is a clear path for using this ""Junk"" training set to
significantly improve our primary machine learning classifier. We also
illustrate the value of Citizen ASAS-SN for identifying unusual variables with
several examples.",2021-11-03T18:00:00Z
"Measuring frequency and period separations in red-giant stars using
  machine learning","Asteroseismology is used to infer the interior physics of stars. The
\textit{Kepler} and TESS space missions have provided a vast data set of
red-giant light curves, which may be used for asteroseismic analysis. These
data sets are expected to significantly grow with future missions such as
\textit{PLATO}, and efficient methods are therefore required to analyze these
data rapidly. Here, we describe a machine learning algorithm that identifies
red giants from the raw oscillation spectra and captures \textit{p} and
\textit{mixed} mode parameters from the red-giant power spectra. We report
algorithmic inferences for large frequency separation ($\Delta \nu$), frequency
at maximum amplitude ($\nu_{max}$), and period separation ($\Delta \Pi$) for an
ensemble of stars. In addition, we have discovered $\sim$25 new probable red
giants among 151,000 \textit{Kepler} long-cadence stellar-oscillation spectra
analyzed by the method, among which four are binary candidates which appear to
possess red-giant counterparts. To validate the results of this method, we
selected $\sim$ 3,000 \textit{Kepler} stars, at various evolutionary stages
ranging from subgiants to red clumps, and compare inferences of $\Delta \nu$,
$\Delta \Pi$, and $\nu_{max}$ with estimates obtained using other techniques.
The power of the machine-learning algorithm lies in its speed: it is able to
accurately extract seismic parameters from 1,000 spectra in $\sim$5 seconds on
a modern computer (single core of the Intel Xeon Platinum 8280 CPU).",2022-02-15T17:37:45Z
"A Deep-Learning Approach for Operation of an Automated Realtime Flare

providing statistical insights to flare-trigger mechanisms, and by enabling
tailor-made forecasts and high-frequency forecasts. Only by realtime forecast
we can experimentally measure the performance of flare-forecasting methods
while confidently avoiding overlearning.
  We have been operating unmanned flare forecast service since August, 2015

eclipsing binary systems based on their light curves. The algorithm trains the
machine with light curve images generated from the observational data of
eclipsing binary stars in contact, detached and semi-detached morphologies,
whose light curves are provided by Kepler, ASAS and CALEB catalogues. The

algorithm, which is selected among 132 neural network architectures, estimates
the morphological classes of an independent validation dataset, 705 real data,
with an accuracy of 92%.",2023-06-05T08:27:40Z
Deep Learning Based Reconstruction of Total Solar Irradiance,"The Earth's primary source of energy is the radiant energy generated by the
Sun, which is referred to as solar irradiance, or total solar irradiance (TSI)
when all of the radiation is measured. A minor change in the solar irradiance
can have a significant impact on the Earth's climate and atmosphere. As a
result, studying and measuring solar irradiance is crucial in understanding
climate changes and solar variability. Several methods have been developed to
reconstruct total solar irradiance for long and short periods of time; however,
they are physics-based and rely on the availability of data, which does not go
beyond 9,000 years. In this paper we propose a new method, called TSInet, to
reconstruct total solar irradiance by deep learning for short and long periods
of time that span beyond the physical models' data availability. On the data
that are available, our method agrees well with the state-of-the-art
physics-based reconstruction models. To our knowledge, this is the first time
that deep learning has been used to reconstruct total solar irradiance for more
than 9,000 years.",2021-07-23T06:33:37Z
"Homogenising SoHO/EIT and SDO/AIA 171Å$~$ Images: A Deep Learning
  Approach","Extreme Ultraviolet images of the Sun are becoming an integral part of space
weather prediction tasks. However, having different surveys requires the
development of instrument-specific prediction algorithms. As an alternative, it
is possible to combine multiple surveys to create a homogeneous dataset. In
this study, we utilize the temporal overlap of SoHO/EIT and SDO/AIA 171~\AA
~surveys to train an ensemble of deep learning models for creating a single
homogeneous survey of EUV images for 2 solar cycles. Prior applications of deep
learning have focused on validating the homogeneity of the output while
overlooking the systematic estimation of uncertainty. We use an approach called
`Approximate Bayesian Ensembling' to generate an ensemble of models whose
uncertainty mimics that of a fully Bayesian neural network at a fraction of the
cost. We find that ensemble uncertainty goes down as the training set size
increases. Additionally, we show that the model ensemble adds immense value to
the prediction by showing higher uncertainty in test data that are not well
represented in the training data.",2023-08-20T17:17:27Z
"Pan-chromatic photometric classification of supernovae from multiple
  surveys and transfer learning for future surveys","Time-domain astronomy is entering a new era as wide-field surveys with higher
cadences allow for more discoveries than ever before. The field has seen an
increased use of machine learning and deep learning for automated
classification of transients into established taxonomies. Training such
classifiers requires a large enough and representative training set, which is
not guaranteed for new future surveys such as the Vera Rubin Observatory,
especially at the beginning of operations. We present the use of Gaussian
processes to create a uniform representation of supernova light curves from
multiple surveys, obtained through the Open Supernova Catalog for supervised
classification with convolutional neural networks. We also investigate the use
of transfer learning to classify light curves from the Photometric LSST
Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) dataset. Using
convolutional neural networks to classify the Gaussian process generated
representation of supernova light curves from multiple surveys, we achieve an
AUC score of 0.859 for classification into Type Ia, Ibc, and II. We find that
transfer learning improves the classification accuracy for the most
under-represented classes by up to 18% when classifying PLAsTiCC light curves,
and is able to achieve an AUC score of 0.945 when including photometric
redshifts for classification into six classes (Ia, Iax, Ia-91bg, Ibc, II,
SLSN-I). We also investigate the usefulness of transfer learning when there is
a limited labelled training set to see how this approach can be used for
training classifiers in future surveys at the beginning of operations.",2022-08-02T09:23:54Z
Tracing Halpha Fibrils through Bayesian Deep Learning,"We present a new deep learning method, dubbed FibrilNet, for tracing
chromospheric fibrils in Halpha images of solar observations. Our method
consists of a data pre-processing component that prepares training data from a
threshold-based tool, a deep learning model implemented as a Bayesian
convolutional neural network for probabilistic image segmentation with
uncertainty quantification to predict fibrils, and a post-processing component
containing a fibril-fitting algorithm to determine fibril orientations. The
FibrilNet tool is applied to high-resolution Halpha images from an active
region (AR 12665) collected by the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope (GST) equipped
with high-order adaptive optics at the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). We
quantitatively assess the FibrilNet tool, comparing its image segmentation
algorithm and fibril-fitting algorithm with those employed by the
threshold-based tool. Our experimental results and major findings are
summarized as follows. First, the image segmentation results (i.e., detected
fibrils) of the two tools are quite similar, demonstrating the good learning
capability of FibrilNet. Second, FibrilNet finds more accurate and smoother
fibril orientation angles than the threshold-based tool. Third, FibrilNet is
faster than the threshold-based tool and the uncertainty maps produced by
FibrilNet not only provide a quantitative way to measure the confidence on each
detected fibril, but also help identify fibril structures that are not detected
by the threshold-based tool but are inferred through machine learning. Finally,
we apply FibrilNet to full-disk Halpha images from other solar observatories
and additional high-resolution Halpha images collected by BBSO/GST,
demonstrating the tool's usability in diverse datasets.",2021-07-16T13:14:33Z
"Explaining Full-disk Deep Learning Model for Solar Flare Prediction
  using Attribution Methods","This paper contributes to the growing body of research on deep learning
methods for solar flare prediction, primarily focusing on highly overlooked
near-limb flares and utilizing the attribution methods to provide a post hoc
qualitative explanation of the model's predictions. We present a solar flare
prediction model, which is trained using hourly full-disk line-of-sight
magnetogram images and employs a binary prediction mode to forecast
$\geq$M-class flares that may occur within the following 24-hour period. To
address the class imbalance, we employ a fusion of data augmentation and class
weighting techniques; and evaluate the overall performance of our model using
the true skill statistic (TSS) and Heidke skill score (HSS). Moreover, we
applied three attribution methods, namely Guided Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping, Integrated Gradients, and Deep Shapley Additive
Explanations, to interpret and cross-validate our model's predictions with the
explanations. Our analysis revealed that full-disk prediction of solar flares
aligns with characteristics related to active regions (ARs). In particular, the
key findings of this study are: (1) our deep learning models achieved an
average TSS=0.51 and HSS=0.35, and the results further demonstrate a competent
capability to predict near-limb solar flares and (2) the qualitative analysis
of the model explanation indicates that our model identifies and uses features
associated with ARs in central and near-limb locations from full-disk
magnetograms to make corresponding predictions. In other words, our models
learn the shape and texture-based characteristics of flaring ARs even at
near-limb areas, which is a novel and critical capability with significant
implications for operational forecasting.",2023-07-29T03:18:56Z
"Automatic classification of K2 pulsating stars using machine learning
  techniques","The second mission of the NASA Kepler satellite, K2, has collected hundreds
of thousands of lightcurves for stars close to the ecliptic plane. This new
sample could increase the number of known pulsating stars and then improve our
understanding of those stars. For the moment only a few stars have been
properly classified and published. In this work, we present a method to
automaticly classify K2 pulsating stars using a Machine Learning technique
called Random Forest. The objective is to sort out the stars in four classes:
red giant (RG), main-sequence Solar-like stars (SL), classical pulsators (PULS)
and Other. To do this we use the effective temperatures and the luminosities of
the stars as well as the FliPer features, that measures the amount of power
contained in the power spectral density. The classifier now retrieves the right
classification for more than 80% of the stars.",2019-06-23T17:11:40Z
"Feature ranking of active region source properties in solar flare
  forecasting and the uncompromised stochasticity of flare occurrence","Solar flares originate from magnetically active regions but not all solar
active regions give rise to a flare. Therefore, the challenge of solar flare
prediction benefits by an intelligent computational analysis of physics-based
properties extracted from active region observables, most commonly
line-of-sight or vector magnetograms of the active-region photosphere. For the
purpose of flare forecasting, this study utilizes an unprecedented 171
flare-predictive active region properties, mainly inferred by the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI) in the
course of the European Union Horizon 2020 FLARECAST project. Using two
different supervised machine learning methods that allow feature ranking as a
function of predictive capability, we show that: i) an objective training and
testing process is paramount for the performance of every supervised machine
learning method; ii) most properties include overlapping information and are
therefore highly redundant for flare prediction; iii) solar flare prediction is
still - and will likely remain - a predominantly probabilistic challenge.",2019-06-28T08:44:46Z
Visualizing and Interpreting Unsupervised Solar Wind Classifications,"One of the goals of machine learning is to eliminate tedious and arduous
repetitive work. The manual and semi-automatic classification of millions of
hours of solar wind data from multiple missions can be replaced by automatic
algorithms that can discover, in mountains of multi-dimensional data, the real
differences in the solar wind properties. In this paper we present how
unsupervised clustering techniques can be used to segregate different types of
solar wind. We propose the use of advanced data reduction methods to
pre-process the data, and we introduce the use of Self-Organizing Maps to
visualize and interpret 14 years of ACE data. Finally, we show how these
techniques can potentially be used to uncover hidden information, and how they
compare with previous manual and automatic categorizations.",2020-04-28T11:24:50Z
"Chemo-kinematic analysis of metal-poor stars with unsupervised machine

of the stars. In this work, we report on preliminary results of an on-going
chemo-kinematic analysis of a sample of metal-poor ([Fe/H] $\leq$ -1.0) stars
observed by the GALAH spectroscopic survey. We explored the chemical and
orbital data with unsupervised machine learning (hierarchical clustering,

an optimal way to separate different Galactic stellar populations and stellar
groups originating from merging events, such as Gaia-Enceladus and Sequoia.",2020-12-07T19:00:01Z
Parametrization of sunspot groups based on machine learning approach,"Sunspot groups observed in white-light appear as complex structures. Analysis
of these structures is usually based on simple morphological descriptors which
capture only generic properties and miss information about fine details. We
present a machine learning approach to introduce a complete yet compact
description of sunspot groups. The idea is to map sunspot group images into an
appropriate lower-dimensional (latent) space. We apply a combination of
Variational Autoencoder and Principal Component Analysis to obtain a set of 285
latent descriptors. We demonstrate that the standard descriptors are embedded
into the latent ones. Thus, latent features can be considered as an extended
description of sunspot groups and, in our opinion, can expand the possibilities
for the research on sunspot groups. In particular, we demonstrate an
application for estimation of the sunspot group complexity. The proposed
parametrization model is generic and can be applied to investigation of other
traces of solar activity observed in various spectrum lines. Key components of
this work, which are the parametrization model, dataset of sunspot groups and
latent vectors, are available in the public GitHub repository
github.com/observethesun/sunspot_groups and can be used to reproduce the
results and for further research.",2022-01-15T12:19:42Z
Physically Interpretable Machine Learning for nuclear masses,"We present a novel approach to modeling the ground state mass of atomic
nuclei based directly on a probabilistic neural network constrained by relevant
physics. Our Physically Interpretable Machine Learning (PIML) approach
incorporates knowledge of physics by using a physically motivated feature space
in addition to a soft physics constraint that is implemented as a penalty to
the loss function. We train our PIML model on a random set of $\sim$20\% of the
Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME) and predict the remaining $\sim$80\%. The success
of our methodology is exhibited by the unprecedented
$\sigma_\textrm{RMS}\sim186$ keV match to data for the training set and
$\sigma_\textrm{RMS}\sim316$ keV for the entire AME with $Z \geq 20$. We show
that our general methodology can be interpreted using feature importance.",2022-03-20T16:33:50Z
"Bayesian averaging for ground state masses of atomic nuclei in a Machine

In addition to training on this data, a physics-based loss function is employed
to help refine the solutions. The resultant Bayesian averaged predictions have
excellent performance compared to the testing set and come with well-quantified
uncertainties which are critical for contemporary scientific applications. We
assess extrapolations of the model's predictions and estimate the growth of
uncertainties in the region far from measurements.",2023-04-17T18:24:45Z
"Characterizing Solar Spicules and their Role in Solar Wind Production
  using Machine Learning and the Hough Transform","Solar winds originate from the Sun and can be classified as fast or slow.
Fast solar winds come from coronal holes at the solar poles, while slow solar
winds may originate from the equatorial region or streamers. Spicules are
jet-like structures observed in the Sun's chromosphere and transition region.
Some spicules exhibit rotating motion, potentially indicating vorticity and
Alfven waves. Machine learning and the Hough algorithm were used to analyze
over 3000 frames of the Sun, identifying spicules and their characteristics.
The study found that rotating spicules, accounting for 21 percent at the poles
and 4 percent at the equator, play a role in energy transfer to the upper solar
atmosphere. The observations suggest connections between spicules, mini-loops,
magnetic reconnection, and the acceleration of fast solar winds. Understanding
these small-scale structures is crucial for comprehending the origin and
heating of the fast solar wind.",2024-08-13T19:15:09Z
"Spectroscopic observations of the machine-learning selected anomaly
  catalogue from the AllWISE Sky Survey","We present the results of a programme to search and identify the nature of
unusual sources within the All-sky Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)
that is based on a machine-learning algorithm for anomaly detection, namely
one-class support vector machines (OCSVM). Designed to detect sources deviating
from a training set composed of known classes, this algorithm was used to
create a model for the expected data based on WISE objects with spectroscopic
identifications in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Subsequently, it marked
as anomalous those sources whose WISE photometry was shown to be inconsistent
with this model. We report the results from optical and near-infrared
spectroscopy follow-up observations of a subset of 36 bright ($g_{AB}$<19.5)
objects marked as 'anomalous' by the OCSVM code to verify its performance.
Among the observed objects, we identified three main types of sources: i) low
redshift (z~0.03-0.15) galaxies containing large amounts of hot dust (53%),
including three Wolf-Rayet galaxies; ii) broad-line quasi-stellar objects
(QSOs) (33%) including low-ionisation broad absorption line (LoBAL) quasars and
a rare QSO with strong and narrow ultraviolet iron emission; iii) Galactic
objects in dusty phases of their evolution (3%). The nature of four of these
objects (11%) remains undetermined due to low signal-to-noise or featureless
spectra. The current data show that the algorithm works well at detecting rare
but not necessarily unknown objects among the brightest candidates. They mostly
represent peculiar sub-types of otherwise well-known sources.",2020-08-24T19:04:30Z
Transfer Learning Applied to Stellar Light Curve Classification,"Context. Variability carries physical patterns and astronomical information
of objects, and stellar light curve variations are essential to understand the
stellar formation and evolution processes. The studies of variations in stellar
photometry have the potential to expand the list of known stars, protostars,
binary stars, and compact objects, which could shed more light on stages of
stellar lifecycles. Aims. The progress in machine-learning techniques and
applications has developed modern algorithms to detect and condense features
from big data, which enables us to classify stellar light curves efficiently
and effectively. Methods. We explore several deep-learning methods on variable
star classifications. The sample of light curves is constructed with delta
Scuti, gamma Doradus, RR Lyrae, eclipsing binaries, and hybrid variables from
Kepler observations. Several algorithms are applied to transform the light
curves into images, continuous wavelet transform (CWT), Gramian angular fields,
and recurrent plots. We also explore the representation ability of these
algorithms. The processed images are fed to several deep-learning methods for
image recognition, including VGG-19, GoogLeNet, Inception-v3, ResNet,
SqueezeNet, and Xception architectures. Results. The best transformation method
is CWT, resulting in an average accuracy of 95.6\%. VGG-19 shows the highest
average accuracy of 93.25\% among all architectures, while it shows the highest
accuracy of 97.2\% under the CWT transformation method. The prediction can
reach about 1000 light curves per second by using NVIDIA RTX 3090. Our results
indicate that the combination of big data and deep learning opens a new path to
classify light curves automatically.",2023-05-23T07:04:05Z
"Application of Convolutional Neural Networks for Stellar Spectral
  Classification","Due to the ever-expanding volume of observed spectroscopic data from surveys
such as SDSS and LAMOST, it has become important to apply artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques for analysing stellar spectra to solve spectral
classification and regression problems like the determination of stellar
atmospheric parameters Teff, log g, [Fe/H]. We propose an automated approach
for the classification of stellar spectra in the optical region using
Convolutional Neural Networks. Traditional machine learning (ML) methods with
""shallow"" architecture (usually up to 2 hidden layers) have been trained for
these purposes in the past. However, deep learning methods with a larger number
of hidden layers allow the use of finer details in the spectrum which results
in improved accuracy and better generalisation. Studying finer spectral
signatures also enables us to determine accurate differential stellar
parameters and find rare objects. We examine various machine and deep learning
algorithms like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify stellar spectra using the Jacoby
Atlas, ELODIE and MILES spectral libraries as training samples. We test the
performance of the trained networks on the Indo-U.S. Library of Coude Feed
Stellar Spectra (CFLIB). We show that using convolutional neural networks, we
are able to lower the error up to 1.23 spectral sub-classes as compared to that
of 2 sub-classes achieved in the past studies with ML approach. We further
apply the trained model to classify stellar spectra retrieved from the SDSS
database with SNR>20.",2019-09-12T05:22:34Z
"A semi-supervised Machine Learning search for never-seen
  Gravitational-Wave sources","By now, tens of gravitational-wave (GW) events have been detected by the LIGO
and Virgo detectors. These GWs have all been emitted by compact binary
coalescence, for which we have excellent predictive models. However, there
might be other sources for which we do not have reliable models. Some are
expected to exist but to be very rare (e.g., supernovae), while others may be
totally unanticipated. So far, no unmodeled sources have been discovered, but
the lack of models makes the search for such sources much more difficult and
less sensitive. We present here a search for unmodeled GW signals using
semi-supervised machine learning. We apply deep learning and outlier detection
algorithms to labeled spectrograms of GW strain data, and then search for
spectrograms with anomalous patterns in public LIGO data. We searched $\sim
13\%$ of the coincident data from the first two observing runs. No candidates
of GW signals were detected in the data analyzed. We evaluate the sensitivity
of the search using simulated signals, we show that this search can detect
spectrograms containing unusual or unexpected GW patterns, and we report the
waveforms and amplitudes for which a $50\%$ detection rate is achieved.",2020-10-22T18:00:00Z
"Simultaneous Multivariate Forecast of Space Weather Indices using Deep
  Neural Network Ensembles","Solar radio flux along with geomagnetic indices are important indicators of
solar activity and its effects. Extreme solar events such as flares and
geomagnetic storms can negatively affect the space environment including
satellites in low-Earth orbit. Therefore, forecasting these space weather
indices is of great importance in space operations and science. In this study,
we propose a model based on long short-term memory neural networks to learn the
distribution of time series data with the capability to provide a simultaneous
multivariate 27-day forecast of the space weather indices using time series as
well as solar image data. We show a 30-40\% improvement of the root mean-square
error while including solar image data with time series data compared to using
time series data alone. Simple baselines such as a persistence and running
average forecasts are also compared with the trained deep neural network
models. We also quantify the uncertainty in our prediction using a model
ensemble.",2021-12-16T17:42:49Z
"Predicting Solar Energetic Particles Using SDO/HMI Vector Magnetic Data
  Products and a Bidirectional LSTM Network","Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are an essential source of space radiation,
which are hazards for humans in space, spacecraft, and technology in general.
In this paper we propose a deep learning method, specifically a bidirectional
long short-term memory (biLSTM) network, to predict if an active region (AR)
would produce an SEP event given that (i) the AR will produce an M- or X-class
flare and a coronal mass ejection (CME) associated with the flare, or (ii) the
AR will produce an M- or X-class flare regardless of whether or not the flare
is associated with a CME. The data samples used in this study are collected
from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite's X-ray flare
catalogs provided by the National Centers for Environmental Information. We
select M- and X-class flares with identified ARs in the catalogs for the period
between 2010 and 2021, and find the associations of flares, CMEs and SEPs in
the Space Weather Database of Notifications, Knowledge, Information during the
same period. Each data sample contains physical parameters collected from the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory.
Experimental results based on different performance metrics demonstrate that
the proposed biLSTM network is better than related machine learning algorithms
for the two SEP prediction tasks studied here. We also discuss extensions of
our approach for probabilistic forecasting and calibration with empirical
evaluation.",2022-03-27T21:06:08Z
"Barium stars as tracers of s-process nucleosynthesis in AGB stars II.
  Using machine learning techniques on 169 stars","We aim to analyse the abundance pattern of 169 Barium (Ba) stars, using
machine learning techniques and the AGB final surface abundances predicted by
Fruity and Monash stellar models. We developed machine learning algorithms that
use the abundance pattern of Ba stars as input to classify the initial mass and
metallicity of its companion star using stellar model predictions. We use two
algorithms: the first exploits neural networks to recognise patterns and the
second is a nearest-neighbour algorithm, which focuses on finding the AGB model
that predicts final surface abundances closest to the observed Ba star values.
In the second algorithm we include the error bars and observational
uncertainties to find the best fit model. The classification process is based
on the abundances of Fe, Rb, Sr, Zr, Ru, Nd, Ce, Sm, and Eu. We selected these
elements by systematically removing s-process elements from our AGB model
abundance distributions, and identifying those whose removal has the biggest
positive effect on the classification. We excluded Nb, Y, Mo, and La. Our final
classification combines the output of both algorithms to identify for each Ba
star companion an initial mass and metallicity range. With our analysis tools
we identify the main properties for 166 of the 169 Ba stars in the stellar
sample. The classifications based on both stellar sets of AGB final abundances
show similar distributions, with an average initial mass of M = 2.23 MSun and
2.34 MSun and an average [Fe/H] = -0.21 and -0.11, respectively. We
investigated why the removal of Nb, Y, Mo, and La improves our classification
and identified 43 stars for which the exclusion had the biggest effect. We show
that these stars have statistically significant different abundances for these
elements compared to the other Ba stars in our sample. We discuss the possible
reasons for these differences in the abundance patterns.",2022-12-07T12:18:06Z
"A catalogue of asteroseismically calibrated ages for APOGEE DR17. The
  predictions of a CatBoost machine learning model based on the [Mg/Ce]
  chemical clock and other stellar parameters","Context. Understanding the Milky Way's formation and evolution across cosmic
epochs necessitates precise stellar age determination across all Galactic
components. Recent advancements in asteroseismology, spectroscopy, stellar
modelling, and machine learning, coupled with all-sky surveys, now offer highly
reliable stellar age estimates. Aims. This study aims to furnish accurate age
assessments for the Main Red Star Sample within the APOGEE DR17 catalogue.
Leveraging asteroseismic age constraints, we employ machine learning to achieve
this goal. Methods. We explore optimal non-asteroseismic stellar parameters,
including T$_{eff}$, L, [CI/N], [Mg/Ce], [$\alpha$/Fe], U(LSR) velocity, and
'Z' vertical height from the Galactic plane, to predict ages via categorical
gradient boost decision trees. Training merges samples from the TESS Southern
Continuous Viewing Zone and Second APOKASC catalogue to mitigate data shifts,
enhancing prediction reliability. Validation employs an independent dataset
from the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program. Results. Our model yields a median
fractional age error of 20.8%, with a prediction variance of 4.77%. Median
fractional errors for stars older than 3 Gyr range from 7% to 23%, from 1 to 3
Gyr range from 26% to 28%, and for stars younger than 1 Gyr, it's 43%.
Applicable to 125,445 stars in the APOGEE DR17 Main Red Star Sample, our
analysis confirms previous findings on the young Galactic disc's flaring and
reveals an age gradient among the youngest Galactic plane stars. Additionally,
we identify two groups of metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -1 dex) young stars (Age < 2
Gyr) exhibiting similar chemical abundances and halo kinematics, likely
remnants of the predicted third gas infall episode (~2.7 Gyr ago).",2024-03-29T17:04:03Z
Be Stars in the Open Cluster NGC 6830,"We report the discovery of 2 new Be stars, and re-identify one known Be star
in the open cluster NGC 6830. Eleven H-alpha emitters were discovered using the
H-alpha imaging photometry of the Palomar Transient Factory Survey. Stellar
membership of the candidates was verified with photometric and kinematic
information using 2MASS data and proper motions. The spectroscopic confirmation
was carried out by using the Shane 3-m telescope at Lick observatory. Based on
their spectral types, three H-alpha emitters were confirmed as Be stars with
H-alpha equivalent widths > -10 Angstrom. Two objects were also observed by the
new spectrograph SED-Machine on the Palomar 60 inch Telescope. The SED-Machine
results show strong H-alpha emission lines, which are consistent with the
results of the Lick observations. The high efficiency of the SED-Machine can
provide rapid observations for Be stars in a comprehensive survey in the
future.",2016-04-08T08:48:22Z
"Deep-SWIM: A few-shot learning approach to classify Solar WInd Magnetic
  field structures","The solar wind consists of charged particles ejected from the Sun into
interplanetary space and towards Earth. Understanding the magnetic field of the
solar wind is crucial for predicting future space weather and planetary
atmospheric loss. Compared to large-scale magnetic events, smaller-scale
structures like magnetic discontinuities are hard to detect but entail
important information on the evolution of the solar wind. A lack of labeled
data makes an automated detection of these discontinuities challenging. We
propose Deep-SWIM, an approach leveraging advances in contrastive learning,
pseudo-labeling and online hard example mining to robustly identify
discontinuities in solar wind magnetic field data. Through a systematic
ablation study, we show that we can accurately classify discontinuities despite
learning from only limited labeled data. Additionally, we show that our
approach generalizes well and produces results that agree with expert
hand-labeling.",2022-03-02T15:35:15Z
"Explainable Deep Learning-based Solar Flare Prediction with post hoc
  Attention for Operational Forecasting","This paper presents a post hoc analysis of a deep learning-based full-disk
solar flare prediction model. We used hourly full-disk line-of-sight
magnetogram images and selected binary prediction mode to predict the
occurrence of $\geq$M1.0-class flares within 24 hours. We leveraged custom data
augmentation and sample weighting to counter the inherent class-imbalance
problem and used true skill statistic and Heidke skill score as evaluation
metrics. Recent advancements in gradient-based attention methods allow us to
interpret models by sending gradient signals to assign the burden of the
decision on the input features. We interpret our model using three post hoc
attention methods: (i) Guided Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, (ii)
Deep Shapley Additive Explanations, and (iii) Integrated Gradients. Our
analysis shows that full-disk predictions of solar flares align with
characteristics related to the active regions. The key findings of this study
are: (1) We demonstrate that our full disk model can tangibly locate and
predict near-limb solar flares, which is a critical feature for operational
flare forecasting, (2) Our candidate model achieves an average
TSS=0.51$\pm$0.05 and HSS=0.38$\pm$0.08, and (3) Our evaluation suggests that
these models can learn conspicuous features corresponding to active regions
from full-disk magnetograms.",2023-08-04T19:33:25Z
"Active Learning for Computationally Efficient Distribution of Binary
  Evolution Simulations","Binary stars undergo a variety of interactions and evolutionary phases,
critical for predicting and explaining observed properties. Binary population
synthesis with full stellar-structure and evolution simulations are
computationally expensive requiring a large number of mass-transfer sequences.
The recently developed binary population synthesis code POSYDON incorporates
grids of MESA binary star simulations which are then interpolated to model
large-scale populations of massive binaries. The traditional method of
computing a high-density rectilinear grid of simulations is not scalable for
higher-dimension grids, accounting for a range of metallicities, rotation, and
eccentricity. We present a new active learning algorithm, psy-cris, which uses
machine learning in the data-gathering process to adaptively and iteratively
select targeted simulations to run, resulting in a custom, high-performance
training set. We test psy-cris on a toy problem and find the resulting training
sets require fewer simulations for accurate classification and regression than
either regular or randomly sampled grids. We further apply psy-cris to the
target problem of building a dynamic grid of MESA simulations, and we
demonstrate that, even without fine tuning, a simulation set of only $\sim 1/4$
the size of a rectilinear grid is sufficient to achieve the same classification
accuracy. We anticipate further gains when algorithmic parameters are optimized
for the targeted application. We find that optimizing for classification only
may lead to performance losses in regression, and vice versa. Lowering the
computational cost of producing grids will enable future versions of POSYDON to
cover more input parameters while preserving interpolation accuracies.",2022-03-30T21:36:32Z
Supervised Ensemble Classification of Kepler Variable Stars,"Variable star analysis and classification is an important task in the
understanding of stellar features and processes. While historically
classifications have been done manually by highly skilled experts, the recent
and rapid expansion in the quantity and quality of data has demanded new
techniques, most notably automatic classification through supervised machine
learning. We present an expansion of existing work on the field by analyzing
variable stars in the {\em Kepler} field using an ensemble approach, combining
multiple characterization and classification techniques to produce improved
classification rates. Classifications for each of the roughly 150,000 stars
observed by {\em Kepler} are produced separating the stars into one of 14

Telescope. This machine learning approach allowed us to identify several
features corresponding to the main structures of the solar photosphere and

We detect for the first time a clear first-overtone pulsation sequence among

Clustering Based Feature Learning on Variable Stars,"The success of automatic classification of variable stars strongly depends on
the lightcurve representation. Usually, lightcurves are represented as a vector
of many statistical descriptors designed by astronomers called features. These
descriptors commonly demand significant computational power to calculate,
require substantial research effort to develop and do not guarantee good
performance on the final classification task. Today, lightcurve representation
is not entirely automatic; algorithms that extract lightcurve features are
designed by humans and must be manually tuned up for every survey. The vast
amounts of data that will be generated in future surveys like LSST mean
astronomers must develop analysis pipelines that are both scalable and
automated. Recently, substantial efforts have been made in the machine learning
community to develop methods that prescind from expert-designed and manually
tuned features for features that are automatically learned from data. In this
work we present what is, to our knowledge, the first unsupervised feature
learning algorithm designed for variable stars. Our method first extracts a
large number of lightcurve subsequences from a given set of photometric data,
which are then clustered to find common local patterns in the time series.
Representatives of these patterns, called exemplars, are then used to transform
lightcurves of a labeled set into a new representation that can then be used to
train an automatic classifier. The proposed algorithm learns the features from
both labeled and unlabeled lightcurves, overcoming the bias generated when the
learning process is done only with labeled data. We test our method on MACHO
and OGLE datasets; the results show that the classification performance we
achieve is as good and in some cases better than the performance achieved using
traditional features, while the computational cost is significantly lower.",2016-02-29T14:26:17Z
"The Sunspot Catalogues of Carrington, Peters, and de la Rue: Quality
  Control and Machine-readable Versions","In the 19th century, several astronomers made observations of sunspots,
recording their positions and sometimes their areas. These observations were
published in the form of extensive tables, but have been unhelpful until now.
Three of these observers were Richard C. Carrington, Christian H. F. Peters,
and Warren de la Rue (and their respective collaborators). They published, in
various articles the data corresponding to 26 641 sunspot positions

positions, respectively). In this paper we present a translation of more than
400 pages of their printed numerical tables into a machine readable format,

"Sunspot latitudes during the Maunder Minimum: a machine-readable
  catalogue from previous studies","The Maunder Minimum (1645-1715 approximately) was a period of very low solar
activity and a strong hemispheric asymmetry, with most of sunspots in the
southern hemisphere. In this paper, two data sets of sunspot latitudes during
the Maunder minimum have been recovered for the international scientific
community. The first data set is constituted by latitudes of sunspots appearing
in the catalogue published by Gustav Sp\""orer nearly 130 years ago. The second
data set is based on the sunspot latitudes displayed in the butterfly diagram
for the Maunder Minimum which was published by Ribes and Nesme-Ribes almost 20
years ago. We have calculated the asymmetry index using these data sets
confirming a strong hemispherical asymmetry in this period. A machine-readable
version of this catalogue with both data sets is available in the Historical
Archive of Sunspot Observations (http://haso.unex.es) and in the appendix of
this article.",2015-01-24T02:03:02Z
Finding flares in Kepler data using machine learning tools,"Archives of long photometric surveys, like the Kepler database, are a gold
mine for studying flares. However, identifying them is a complex task; while in
the case of single-target observations it can be easily done manually by visual
inspection, this is nearly impossible for years-long time series for several
thousand targets. Although there exist automated methods for this task, several
problems are difficult (or impossible) to overcome with traditional fitting and
analysis approaches. We introduce a code for identifying and analyzing flares
based on machine learning methods, which are intrinsically adept at handling
such data sets. We used the RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) algorithm to model
light curves, as it yields robust fits even in case of several outliers, like
flares. The light curve is divided into search windows, approximately in the
order of the stellar rotation period. This search window is shifted over the
data set, and a voting system is used to keep false positives to a minimum:
only those flare candidate points are kept that were identified in several
windows as a flare. The code was tested on the K2 observations of the
TRAPPIST-1, and on the long cadence data of KIC 1722506. The detected flare
events and flare energies are consistent with earlier results from manual
inspections.",2018-06-01T13:35:49Z
"Systematic Serendipity: A Test of Unsupervised Machine Learning as a
  Method for Anomaly Detection","Advances in astronomy are often driven by serendipitous discoveries. As
survey astronomy continues to grow, the size and complexity of astronomical
databases will increase, and the ability of astronomers to manually scour data
and make such discoveries decreases. In this work, we introduce a machine
learning-based method to identify anomalies in large datasets to facilitate
such discoveries, and apply this method to long cadence lightcurves from NASA's
Kepler Mission. Our method clusters data based on density, identifying
anomalies as data that lie outside of dense regions. This work serves as a
proof-of-concept case study and we test our method on four quarters of the
Kepler long cadence lightcurves. We use Kepler's most notorious anomaly,
Boyajian's Star (KIC 8462852), as a rare `ground truth' for testing outlier
identification to verify that objects of genuine scientific interest are
included among the identified anomalies. We evaluate the method's ability to
identify known anomalies by identifying unusual behavior in Boyajian's Star, we
report the full list of identified anomalies for these quarters, and present a
sample subset of identified outliers that includes unusual phenomena, objects
that are rare in the Kepler field, and data artifacts. By identifying <4% of
each quarter as outlying data, we demonstrate that this anomaly detection
method can create a more targeted approach in searching for rare and novel
phenomena.",2018-12-18T03:49:15Z
"Recovering Thermodynamics from Spectral Profiles observed by IRIS: A
  Machine and Deep Learning Approach","Inversion codes allow reconstructing a model atmosphere from observations.
With the inclusion of optically thick lines that form in the solar
chromosphere, such modelling is computationally very expensive because a
non-LTE evaluation of the radiation field is required. In this study, we
combine the results provided by these traditional methods with machine and deep
learning techniques to obtain similar-quality results in an easy-touse, much
faster way. We have applied these new methods to Mg II h&k lines observed by
IRIS. As a result, we are able to reconstruct the thermodynamic state
(temperature, line-of-sight velocity, non-thermal velocities, electron density,
etc.) in the chromosphere and upper photosphere of an area equivalent to an
active region in a few CPU minutes, speeding up the process by a factor of
$10^5$-$10^6$. The open-source code accompanying this paper will allow the
community to use IRIS observations to open a new window to a host of solar
phenomena.",2019-04-17T17:46:02Z
Predicting Solar Flares Using a Long Short-Term Memory Network,"We present a long short-term memory (LSTM) network for predicting whether an
active region (AR) would produce a gamma-class flare within the next 24 hours.
We consider three gamma classes, namely >=M5.0 class, >=M class, and >=C class,
and build three LSTM models separately, each corresponding to a gamma class.
Each LSTM model is used to make predictions of its corresponding gamma-class
flares. The essence of our approach is to model data samples in an AR as time
series and use LSTMs to capture temporal information of the data samples. Each
data sample has 40 features including 25 magnetic parameters obtained from the
Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) and related data products as
well as 15 flare history parameters. We survey the flare events that occurred
from 2010 May to 2018 May, using the GOES X-ray flare catalogs provided by the
National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), and select flares with
identified ARs in the NCEI flare catalogs. These flare events are used to build
the labels (positive vs. negative) of the data samples. Experimental results
show that (i) using only 14-22 most important features including both flare
history and magnetic parameters can achieve better performance than using all
the 40 features together; (ii) our LSTM network outperforms related machine
learning methods in predicting the labels of the data samples. To our
knowledge, this is the first time that LSTMs have been used for solar flare
prediction.",2019-05-17T02:57:13Z
"Predicting Coronal Mass Ejections Using SDO/HMI Vector Magnetic Data
  Products and Recurrent Neural Networks","We present two recurrent neural networks (RNNs), one based on gated recurrent
units and the other based on long short-term memory, for predicting whether an
active region (AR) that produces an M- or X-class flare will also produce a
coronal mass ejection (CME). We model data samples in an AR as time series and
use the RNNs to capture temporal information of the data samples. Each data
sample has 18 physical parameters, or features, derived from photospheric
vector magnetic field data taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We survey M- and X-class flares
that occurred from 2010 May to 2019 May using the Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite's X-ray flare catalogs provided by the National Centers
for Environmental Information (NCEI), and select those flares with identified
ARs in the NCEI catalogs. In addition, we extract the associations of flares
and CMEs from the Space Weather Database Of Notifications, Knowledge,
Information (DONKI). We use the information gathered above to build the labels
(positive versus negative) of the data samples at hand. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our RNNs over closely related machine learning
methods in predicting the labels of the data samples. We also discuss an
extension of our approach to predict a probabilistic estimate of how likely an
M- or X-class flare will initiate a CME, with good performance results. To our
knowledge this is the first time that RNNs have been used for CME prediction.",2020-02-22T11:26:47Z
"Spectral modeling of type II supernovae II. A machine learning approach
  to quantitative spectroscopic analysis","There are now hundreds of publicly available supernova spectral time series.
Radiative transfer modeling of this data gives insights into the physical
properties of these explosions such as the composition, the density structure,
or the intrinsic luminosity---this is invaluable for understanding the
supernova progenitors, the explosion mechanism, or for constraining the
supernova distance. However, a detailed parameter study of the available data
has been out of reach due to the high dimensionality of the problem coupled
with the still significant computational expense. We tackle this issue through
the use of machine-learning emulators, which are algorithms for
high-dimensional interpolation. These use a pre-calculated training dataset to
mimic the output of a complex code but with run times orders of magnitude
shorter. We present the application of such an emulator to synthetic type II
supernova spectra generated with the TARDIS radiative transfer code. The
results show that with a relatively small training set of 780 spectra we can
generate emulated spectra with interpolation uncertainties of less than one
percent. We demonstrate the utility of this method by automatic spectral
fitting of two well-known type IIP supernovae; as an exemplary application, we
determine the supernova distances from the spectral fits using the
tailored-expanding-photosphere method. We compare our results to previous
studies and find good agreement. This suggests that emulation of TARDIS spectra
can likely be used to perform automatic and detailed analysis of many transient
classes putting the analysis of large data repositories within reach.",2019-11-11T18:48:39Z
Searching for Young Stellar Objects through SEDs by Machine Learning,"Accurate measurements of statistical properties, such as the star formation
rate and the lifetime of young stellar objects (YSOs) in different stages, is
essential for constraining star formation theories. However, it is a difficult
task to separate galaxies and YSOs based on spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) alone, because they contain both thermal emission from stars and dust
around them and no reliable theories can be applied to distinguish them. Here
we compare different machine learning algorithms and develop the Spectrum
Classifier of Astronomical Objects (SCAO), based on Fully Connected Neural
Network (FCN), to classify regular stars, galaxies, and YSOs. Superior to
previous classifiers, SCAO is solely trained by high quality data labeled in
Molecular Cores to Planet-forming Disks (c2d) catalog without a priori
theoretical knowledge, and provides excellent results with high precision
(>96%) and recall (>98%) for YSOs when only eight bands are included. We
systematically investigate the effects of observation errors and distance
effects, and show that high accuracy performance is still maintained even when
using fluxes of only three bands (IRAC 3, IRAC 4, and MIPS 1) in the long
wavelengths regime, because the silicate absorption feature is automatically
detected by SCAO. Finally, we apply SCAO to Spitzer Enhanced Imaging Products
(SEIP), the most complete catalog of Spitzer observations, and found 129219 YSO
candidates. The website from SCAO is available at http://scao.astr.nthu.edu.tw.",2020-07-13T08:28:31Z
White dwarfs identified in LAMOST Data Release 5,"In this paper, we report white dwarfs identified in the 5th Data Release of
the Large Area Multi-Object fibre Spectroscopic Telescope, including spectral

stars, 182 DB spectra of 166 DB stars, 62 DC spectra of 58 DC stars, 36 DZ
spectra of 33 DZ stars and many other types identified, in addition to our
previous paper (Data Release 2). Among those sources, 393 DA stars and 46 DB
stars are new identifications after cross-matching with the literature. In
order to select DA candidates, we use the classification result from the LAMOST
pipeline, colour-colour cut method and a random forest machine learning method.
For DBs, since there is no template for DB in the pipeline model, a random
forest machine learning method is chosen to select candidates. All the WD
candidates have been visually checked individually. The parameters of effective
temperature, surface gravity, mass, and cooling age have been estimated for
relatively high signal-to-noise ratio DAs and DBs. The peaks of the DA and DB
mass distributions are found to be around 0.62Msun and 0.65Msun, respectively.
Finally, the data and method we used to select white dwarf candidates for the
second phase of LAMOST survey are also addressed in this paper.",2021-11-09T03:39:44Z
"Identification of Coronal Holes on AIA/SDO images using unsupervised
  Machine Learning","Through its magnetic activity, the Sun governs the conditions in Earth's
vicinity, creating space weather events, which have drastic effects on our
space- and ground-based technology. One of the most important solar magnetic
features creating the space weather is the solar wind, that originates from the
coronal holes (CHs). The identification of the CHs on the Sun as one of the
source regions of the solar wind is therefore crucial to achieve predictive
capabilities. In this study, we used an unsupervised machine learning method,
$k$-means, to pixel-wise cluster the passband images of the Sun taken by the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on {\it the Solar Dynamics Observatory} (AIA/SDO)
in 171 \AA, 193 \AA\,, and 211 \AA\,in different combinations. Our results show
that the pixel-wise $k$-means clustering together with systematic pre- and
post-processing steps provides compatible results with those from complex
methods, such as CNNs. More importantly, our study shows that there is a need
for a CH database that a consensus about the CH boundaries are reached by
observers independently. This database then can be used as the ""ground truth"",
when using a supervised method or just to evaluate the goodness of the models.",2022-03-20T08:41:30Z
"Using Old and New Approaches: Determining Physical Properties of Brown
  Dwarfs with Empirical Relations and Machine Learning Models","We investigate applications of machine learning models to directly infer
physical properties of brown dwarfs from their photometry and spectra using
$\textit{The Cannon}$. We demonstrate that absolute magnitudes, spectral types,
and spectral indices can be determined from low-resolution SpeX prism spectra
of L and T dwarfs without trigonometric parallax measurements and with
precisions competitive with commonly used methods. For T dwarfs with
sufficiently precise spectra and photometry, bolometric luminosities and
effective temperatures can be determined at precisions comparable to methods
that use polynomial relations as a function of absolute magnitudes. We also
provide new and updated polynomial relations for absolute magnitudes as a
function of spectral types L0-T8 in 14 bands spanning Pan-STARRS $r_{P1}$ to
AllWISE $\textit{W3}$, using a volume-limited sample of 256 brown dwarfs
defined entirely by parallaxes. These include the first relations for brown
dwarfs using Pan-STARRS1 photometry and the first for several infrared bands
using a volume-limited sample. We find that our novel method with $\textit{The

the polynomial relations that depend on trigonometric parallax measurements.",2022-03-25T18:00:02Z
"The Gaia EDR3 view of Johnson-Kron-Cousins standard stars: the curated
  Landolt and Stetson collections","(Shortened). In the era of large surveys and space missions, it is necessary
to rely on large samples of well-characterized stars for inter-calibrating and
comparing measurements from different sources. Among the most employed
photometric systems, the Johnson-Kron-Cousins has been used for decades and for
a large amount of important datasets. Using Gaia DR3 as a reference, as well as
data from reddening maps, spectroscopic surveys, and variable stars monitoring
surveys, we curated and characterized the widely used Landolt and Stetson
collections of more than 200 000 secondary standards, removing binaries,
blends, and variable stars, and we classified and parametrized them, employing
classical as well as machine learning techniques. In particular, our
atmospheric parameters agree significantly better with spectroscopic ones,
compared to other catalogues obtained by means of machine learning. We also
cross-matched the collections with the major photometric surveys to provide a
comprehensive table with the magnitudes of the secondary standards in the most
widely used photometric systems (ugriz, grizy, Gaia, Hipparcos, Tycho, 2MASS).

Improving Solar Flare Prediction by Time Series Outlier Detection,"Solar flares not only pose risks to outer space technologies and astronauts'
well being, but also cause disruptions on earth to our hight-tech,
interconnected infrastructure our lives highly depend on. While a number of
machine-learning methods have been proposed to improve flare prediction, none
of them, to the best of our knowledge, have investigated the impact of outliers
on the reliability and those models' performance. In this study, we investigate
the impact of outliers in a multivariate time series benchmark dataset, namely
SWAN-SF, on flare prediction models, and test our hypothesis. That is, there
exist outliers in SWAN-SF, removal of which enhances the performance of the
prediction models on unseen datasets. We employ Isolation Forest to detect the
outliers among the weaker flare instances. Several experiments are carried out
using a large range of contamination rates which determine the percentage of
present outliers. We asses the quality of each dataset in terms of its actual
contamination using TimeSeriesSVC. In our best finding, we achieve a 279%
increase in True Skill Statistic and 68% increase in Heidke Skill Score. The
results show that overall a significant improvement can be achieved to flare
prediction if outliers are detected and removed properly.",2022-06-14T22:54:39Z
"Using machine learning to investigate the populations of dusty evolved
  stars in various metallicities","Mass loss is a key property to understand stellar evolution and in particular
for low-metallicity environments. Our knowledge has improved dramatically over
the last decades both for single and binary evolutionary models. However,
episodic mass loss although definitely present observationally, is not included
in the models, while its role is currently undetermined. A major hindrance is
the lack of large enough samples of classified stars. We attempted to address
this by applying an ensemble machine-learning approach using color indices
(from IR/Spitzer and optical/Pan-STARRS photometry) as features and combining
the probabilities from three different algorithms. We trained on M31 and M33
sources with known spectral classification, which we grouped into
Blue/Yellow/Red/B[e] Supergiants, Luminous Blue Variables, classical Wolf-Rayet
and background galaxies/AGNs. We then applied the classifier to about one
million Spitzer point sources from 25 nearby galaxies, spanning a range of
metallicites ($1/15$ to $\sim3~Z_{\odot}$). Equipped with spectral
classifications we investigated the occurrence of these populations with
metallicity.",2022-09-13T21:10:01Z
"An unsupervised machine learning based algorithm for detecting Weak
  Impulsive Narrowband Quiet Sun Emissions and characterizing their morphology","The solar corona is extremely dynamic. Every leap in observational
capabilities has been accompanied by unexpected revelations of complex dynamic
processes. The ever more sensitive instruments now allow us to probe events
with increasingly weaker energetics. A recent leap in the low-frequency radio
solar imaging ability has led to the discovery of a new class of emissions,
namely Weak Impulsive Narrowband Quiet Sun Emissions
\citep[WINQSEs;][]{mondal2020}. They are hypothesized to be the radio
signatures of coronal nanoflares and could potentially have a bearing on the
long standing coronal heating problem. In view of the significance of this
discovery, this work has been followed up by multiple independent studies.
These include detecting WINQSEs in multiple datasets, using independent
detection techniques and software pipelines, and looking for their counterparts
at other wavelengths. This work focuses on investigating morphological
properties of WINQSEs and also improves upon the methodology used for detecting
WINQSEs in earlier works. We present a machine learning based algorithm to
detect WINQSEs, classify them based on their morphology and model the isolated
ones using 2D Gaussians. We subject multiple datasets to this algorithm to test
its veracity. Interestingly, despite the expectations of their arising from
intrinsically compact sources, WINQSEs tend to be resolved in our observations.
We propose that this angular broadening arises due to coronal scattering.
WINQSEs can, hence, provide ubiquitous and ever-present diagnostic of coronal
scattering (and, in turn, coronal turbulence) in the quiet sun regions, which
has not been possible till date.",2023-06-26T22:52:35Z
"Introducing the ASSESS project: Episodic Mass Loss in Evolved Massive
  Stars -- Key to Understanding the Explosive Early Universe","Episodic mass loss is not understood theoretically, neither accounted for in
state-of-the-art models of stellar evolution, which has far-reaching
consequences for many areas of astronomy. We introduce the ERC-funded ASSESS
project (2018-2024), which aims to determine whether episodic mass loss is a
dominant process in the evolution of the most massive stars, by conducting the
first extensive, multi-wavelength survey of evolved massive stars in the nearby
Universe. It hinges on the fact that mass-losing stars form dust and are bright
in the mid-infrared. We aim to derive physical parameters of $\sim$1000 dusty,
evolved massive stars in $\sim$25 nearby galaxies and estimate the amount of
ejected mass, which will constrain evolutionary models, and quantify the
duration and frequency of episodic mass loss as a function of metallicity. The
approach involves applying machine-learning algorithms to select dusty,
luminous targets from existing multi-band photometry of nearby galaxies. We
present the first results of the project, including the machine-learning
methodology for target selection and results from our spectroscopic
observations so far. The emerging trend for the ubiquity of episodic mass loss,
if confirmed, will be key to understanding the explosive early Universe and
will have profound consequences for low-metallicity stars, reionization, and
the chemical evolution of galaxies.",2023-08-09T11:42:25Z
"Metallicity and $α$-abundance for 48 million stars in
  low-extinction regions in the Milky Way","We estimate ([M/H], [$\alpha$/M]) for 48 million giants and dwarfs in low
dust extinction regions from the Gaia DR3 XP spectra by using tree-based
machine-learning models trained on APOGEE DR17 and metal-poor star sample of Li
et al. The root mean square error of our estimation is 0.0890 dex for [M/H] and
0.0436 dex for [$\alpha$/M], when we evaluate our models with the test data.
Our estimation is most reliable for giants and metal-rich stars, because the
training data are dominated by such stars. The high-[$\alpha$/M] stars and
low-[$\alpha$/M] stars selected by our ([M/H], [$\alpha$/M]) show different
kinematical properties for giants and low-temperature dwarfs. We further
investigate how our machine-learning models extract information on ([M/H],
[$\alpha$/M]). Intriguingly, our models seem to extract information on
[$\alpha$/M] from Na D lines (589 nm) and Mg I line (516 nm). This result is
understandable given the observed correlation between Na and Mg abundances in
the literature. The catalog of ([M/H], [$\alpha$/M]) as well as their
associated uncertainties will be publicly available online.",2024-04-01T17:45:36Z
"NGC1856: Using machine learning techniques to uncover detailed stellar
  abundances from MUSE data","We present the first application of the novel approach based on data-driven
machine learning methods applied to Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE)
field data to derive stellar abundances of star clusters. MUSE has been used to
target more than 10,000 fields, and it is unique in its ability to study dense
stellar fields such as stellar clusters providing spectra for each individual
star. We use MUSE data of the extragalactic young stellar cluster NGC 1856,
located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We present the individual stellar
[Fe/H] abundance of 327 cluster members in addition to [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe],
[Ti/Fe], [C/Fe], [Ni/Fe], and [Cr/Fe] abundances of subsample sets. Our results
match the LMC abundances obtained in the literature for [Mg/Fe], [Ti/Fe],
[Ni/Fe], and [Cr/Fe]. This study is the first to derive [Si/Fe] and [C/Fe]
abundances for this cluster. The revolutionary combination of integral-field
spectroscopy and data-driven modeling will allow us to understand the chemical
enrichment of star clusters and their host galaxies in greater detail expanding
our understanding of galaxy evolution.",2024-04-23T21:18:49Z
"An adaptive parameter estimator for poor-quality spectral data of white
  dwarfs","White dwarfs represent the end stage for 97% of stars, making precise
parameter measurement crucial for understanding stellar evolution. Traditional
estimation methods involve fitting spectra or photometry, which require
high-quality data. In recent years, machine learning has played a crucial role
in processing spectral data due to its speed, automation, and accuracy.
However, two common issues have been identified. First, most studies rely on
data with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR > 10), leaving many poor-quality
datasets underutilized. Second, existing machine learning models, primarily
based on convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and their variants, cannot
simultaneously capture both the spatial and sequential information of spectra.
To address these challenges, we designed the Estimator Network (EstNet), an
advanced algorithm integrating multiple techniques, including Residual
Networks, Squeeze and Excitation Attention, Gated Recurrent Units, Adaptive
Loss, and Monte-Carlo Dropout Layers. We conducted parameter estimation on
5,965 poor-quality white dwarf spectra (R~1800, SNR~1.17), achieving average
percentage errors of 14.86% for effective temperature and 3.97% for surface
gravity. These results are significantly superior to other mainstream
algorithms and consistent with the outcomes of traditional theoretical spectrum
fitting methods. In the future, our algorithms will be applied for large-scale
parameter estimation on the Chinese Space Station Telescope and the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope.",2024-06-06T16:50:33Z
"Searching for Molecular Outflows with Support Vector Machines: Dark
  Cloud Complex in Cygnus","We present a survey of molecular outflows across the dark cloud complex in
the Cygnus region, based on 46.75 deg^2 field of CO isotopologues data from
Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey. A supervised machine learning
algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM), is introduced to accelerate our visual
assessment of outflow features in the data cube of 12CO and 13CO J = 1-0
emission. A total of 130 outflow candidates are identified, of which 77 show
bipolar structures and 118 are new detections. Spatially, these outflows are
located inside dense molecular clouds and some of them are found in clusters or
in elongated linear structures tracing the underlying gas filament morphology.
Along the line of sight, 97, 31, and 2 candidates reside in the Local, Perseus,
and Outer arm, respectively. Young stellar objects as outflow drivers are found
near most outflows, while 36 candidates show no associated source. The clusters
of outflows that we detect are inhomogeneous in their properties; nevertheless,
we show that the outflows cannot inject turbulent energy on cloud scales.
Instead, at best, they are restricted to affecting the so called ""clump"" and
""core"" scales, and this only on short (~0.3 Myr) estimated timescales. Combined
with outflow samples in the literature, our work shows a tight outflow
mass-size correlation.",2020-04-10T02:50:04Z
Estimating Total Solar Irradiance during the 21st century,"The reconstruction and prediction of solar activity is one of the current
problems in dynamo theory and global climate modeling. We estimate the Total
Solar Irradiance for the next hundred years based on the Least Square Support
Vector Machine. We found that the next secular solar minimum will occur between
the years 2003 and 2063 with an average of 1365.4W/m2 close to the Dalton or
Modern minima. We calculate the radiative forcing between the modern maximum
and the 21st century minimum to be -0.1W/m2.",2011-11-11T20:57:08Z
"The Force-Free Electrodynamics Method for the Extrapolation of Coronal
  Magnetic Fields from Vector Magnetograms","We present a new improved version of our force-free electrodynamics (FFE)
numerical code in spherical coordinates that extrapolates the magnetic field in
the inner solar corona from a photospheric vector magnetogram. The code
satisfies the photospheric boundary condition and the condition divB=0 to
machine accuracy. The performance of our method is evaluated with standard
convergence parameters, and is found to be comparable to that of other
nonlinear force-free extrapolations.",2012-09-24T09:53:52Z
Sunspot Catalogue of the Valencia Observatory (1920-1928),"A sunspot catalogue was maintained by the Astronomical Observatory of

machine-readable version of this catalogue (OV catalog or OVc), including a
quality control analysis. Sunspot number (total and hemispheric) and sunspot
area series are constructed using this catalogue. The OV catalog's data are
compared with other available solar data, demonstrating that the present
contribution provides the scientific community with a reliable catalogue of
sunspot data.",2014-07-20T17:44:57Z
"A Deep Learning Approach to Generating Photospheric Vector Magnetograms
  of Solar Active Regions for SOHO/MDI Using SDO/HMI and BBSO Data","Solar activity is usually caused by the evolution of solar magnetic fields.
Magnetic field parameters derived from photospheric vector magnetograms of
solar active regions have been used to analyze and forecast eruptive events
such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Unfortunately, the most recent
solar cycle 24 was relatively weak with few large flares, though it is the only
solar cycle in which consistent time-sequence vector magnetograms have been
available through the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO) since its launch in 2010. In this paper, we look
into another major instrument, namely the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on
board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) from 1996 to 2010. The data
archive of SOHO/MDI covers more active solar cycle 23 with many large flares.
However, SOHO/MDI data only has line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms. We propose a
new deep learning method, named MagNet, to learn from combined LOS
magnetograms, Bx and By taken by SDO/HMI along with H-alpha observations
collected by the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), and to generate vector
components Bx' and By', which would form vector magnetograms with observed LOS
data. In this way, we can expand the availability of vector magnetograms to the
period from 1996 to present. Experimental results demonstrate the good
performance of the proposed method. To our knowledge, this is the first time
that deep learning has been used to generate photospheric vector magnetograms
of solar active regions for SOHO/MDI using SDO/HMI and H-alpha data.",2022-11-04T06:21:32Z
"Hunting for open clusters in \textit{Gaia} DR2: $582$ new OCs in the
  Galactic disc","Open clusters are key targets for both Galaxy structure and evolution and
stellar physics studies. Since \textit{Gaia} DR2 publication, the discovery of
undetected clusters has proven that our samples were not complete. Our aim is
to exploit the Big Data capabilities of machine learning to detect new open
clusters in \textit{Gaia} DR2, and to complete the open cluster sample to
enable further studies on the Galactic disc. We use a machine learning based
methodology to systematically search in the Galactic disc, looking for
overdensities in the astrometric space and identifying them as open clusters
using photometric information. First, we use an unsupervised clustering
algorithm, DBSCAN, to blindly search for these overdensities in \textit{Gaia}
DR2 $(l,b,\varpi,\mu_{\alpha^*},\mu_\delta)$. After that, we use a deep
learning artificial neural network trained on colour-magnitude diagrams to
identify isochrone patterns in these overdensities, and to confirm them as open
clusters. We find $582$ new open clusters distributed along the Galactic disc,
in the region $|b| < 20$. We can detect substructure in complex regions, and
identify the tidal tails of a disrupting cluster UBC~$274$ of $\sim 3$ Gyr
located at $\sim 2$ kpc. Adapting the methodology into a Big Data environment
allows us to target the search driven by physical properties of the open
clusters, instead of being driven by its computational requirements. This blind
search for open clusters in the Galactic disc increases in a $45\%$ the number
of known open clusters.",2020-01-20T14:38:03Z
Anomaly detection in the Zwicky Transient Facility DR3,"We present results from applying the SNAD anomaly detection pipeline to the
third public data release of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF DR3). The
pipeline is composed of 3 stages: feature extraction, search of outliers with
machine learning algorithms and anomaly identification with followup by human
experts. Our analysis concentrates in three ZTF fields, comprising more than
2.25 million objects. A set of 4 automatic learning algorithms was used to
identify 277 outliers, which were subsequently scrutinised by an expert. From
these, 188 (68%) were found to be bogus light curves -- including effects from
the image subtraction pipeline as well as overlapping between a star and a
known asteroid, 66 (24%) were previously reported sources whereas 23 (8%)
correspond to non-catalogued objects, with the two latter cases of potential
scientific interest (e. g. 1 spectroscopically confirmed RS Canum Venaticorum
star, 4 supernovae candidates, 1 red dwarf flare). Moreover, using results from
the expert analysis, we were able to identify a simple bi-dimensional relation
which can be used to aid filtering potentially bogus light curves in future
studies. We provide a complete list of objects with potential scientific
application so they can be further scrutinised by the community. These results
confirm the importance of combining automatic machine learning algorithms with
domain knowledge in the construction of recommendation systems for astronomy.

"Exploring the Polarization of Axially Symmetric Supernovae with
  Unsupervised Deep Learning","The measurement of non-zero polarization can be used to infer the presence of
departures from spherical symmetry in supernovae (SNe). The origin of the
majority of the intrinsic polarization observed in SNe is in electron
scattering, which induces a wavelength-independent continuum polarization that
is generally observed to be low (<1%) for all SN types. The key indicator of
asymmetry in SNe is the polarization observed across spectral lines, in
particular the characteristic ``inverse P Cygni'' profile. The results of a
suite of 900 Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations are presented here.
These simulations cover a range of possible axisymmetric structures (including
unipolar, bipolar and equatorial enhancements) for the line forming region of
the Ca II infrared triplet. Using a Variational Autoencoder, 7 key latent
parameters are learned that describe the relationship between Stokes I and
Stokes q, under the assumption of an axially symmetric line forming region and
resonant scattering. Likelihood-free inference techniques are used to invert
the Stokes I and q line profiles, in the latent space, to derive the underlying
geometries. For axially symmetric structures, that yield an observable
``dominant axis'' on the Stokes $q-u$ plane, we propose the existence of a
geometry ``conjugate"" (which is indistinguishable under a rotation of $\pi
/2$). Using this machine learning infrastructure, we attempt to identify
possible geometries associated with spectropolarimetric observations of the
Type Ib SN 2017gax.",2023-08-31T12:42:16Z
Signal detection for spectroscopy and polarimetry,"The analysis of high spectral resolution spectroscopic and
spectropolarimetric observations constitute a very powerful way of inferring
the dynamical, thermodynamical, and magnetic properties of distant objects.
However, these techniques are photon-starving, making it difficult to use them
for all purposes. One of the problems commonly found is just detecting the
presence of a signal that is buried on the noise at the wavelength of some
interesting spectral feature. This is specially relevant for
spectropolarimetric observations because typically, only a small fraction of
the received light is polarized. We present in this note a Bayesian technique
for the detection of spectropolarimetric signals. The technique is based on the
application of the non-parametric relevance vector machine to the observations,
which allows us to compute the evidence for the presence of the signal and
compute the more probable signal. The method would be suited for analyzing data
from experimental instruments onboard space missions and rockets aiming at
detecting spectropolarimetric signals in unexplored regions of the spectrum
such as the Chromospheric Lyman-Alpha Spectro-Polarimeter (CLASP) sounding
rocket experiment.",2012-09-28T09:11:05Z
"The solar rotation in the period 1853-1870 from the sunspot catalogues

the second half of the 19th century, determining their heliographic positions
between 1853 and 1870, before the establishment of the solar program of the
Royal Greenwich Observatory. The large tables of sunspot positions included in
the catalogues published by these observers have recently been converted to a
machine readable format. The present work analyses this data by calculating the
sunspot group velocities for each observer. These results are then fitted with
a differential rotation law to compare the data of the three observers with
each other and with the results published by other authors. Finally, a study is
made of the possible relationship between the sunspot group areas as determined
by de la Rue and the corresponding sunspot group velocities.",2014-10-30T08:22:24Z
"Distance Dependent Offsets between Parallaxes for Nearby Stars and Gaia
  DR1 Parallaxes","We use 612 single stars with previously published trigonometric parallaxes
placing them within 25 pc to evaluate parallaxes released in Gaia's first data
release (DR1). We find that the Gaia parallaxes are, on average, $0.24 \pm
0.02$ mas smaller than the weighted mean trigonometric parallax values for
these stars in the solar neighborhood. We also find that the offset changes
with distance out to 100 pc, in the sense that the closer the star, the larger
the offset. We find no systematic trends in the parallax offsets with stellar
$V$ magnitude, $V-K$ color, or proper motion. We do find that the offset is
roughly twice as large for stars south of the ecliptic compared to those that
are north.",2016-11-02T15:43:19Z
"A Sunspot Catalog for the Period 1952-1986 from Observations Made at the

A WISE Survey of Circumstellar Disks in Taurus,"We have compiled photometry at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 $\mu$m from the all-sky
survey performed by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) for all

photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope, we have identified members with
infrared excess emission from circumstellar disks and have estimated the
evolutionary stages of the detected disks, which include 31 new full disks and
16 new candidate transitional, evolved, evolved transitional, and debris disks.
We have also used the WISE All-Sky Source Catalog to search for new
disk-bearing members of Taurus based on their red infrared colors. Through
optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, we have confirmed 26 new members with
spectral types of M1 - M7. The census of disk-bearing stars in Taurus should
now be largely complete for spectral types earlier than $\sim$M8 ($M \gtrsim

  application to colour-colour diagrams","We are totally immersed in the Big Data era and reliable algorithms and
methods for data classification are instrumental for astronomical research.
Random Forest and Support Vector Machines algorithms have become popular over
the last few years and they are widely used for different stellar
classification problems. In this article, we explore an alternative supervised
classification method scarcely exploited in astronomy, Logistic Regression,
that has been applied successfully in other scientific areas, particularly
biostatistics. We have applied this method in order to derive membership
probabilities for potential T Tauri star candidates from ultraviolet-infrared

New Young Stars and Brown Dwarfs in the Upper Scorpius Association,"To improve the census of the Upper Sco association (~11 Myr, ~145 pc), we
have identified candidate members using parallaxes, proper motions, and
color-magnitude diagrams from several wide-field imaging surveys and have
obtained optical and infrared spectra of several hundred candidates to measure
their spectral types and assess their membership. We also have performed
spectroscopy on a smaller sample of previously known or suspected members to
refine their spectral types and evidence of membership. We have classified 530
targets as members of Upper Sco, 377 of which lack previous spectroscopy. Our
new compilation of all known members of the association contains 1631 objects.
Although the census of Upper Sco has expanded significantly over the last
decade, there remain hundreds of candidates that lack spectroscopy. The precise
parallaxes and proper motions from the second data release of Gaia should
extend down to substellar masses in Upper Sco, which will greatly facilitate
the identification of the undiscovered members.",2018-07-20T17:56:45Z

sunspot area according to this catalogue, comparing it with the sunspot number
index (version 2) and Balmaceda sunspot area series (Balmaceda et al., J.

studies about solar activity.",2021-03-16T18:39:51Z
"Hubble Tarantula Treasury Project - VI. Identification of
  Pre-Main-Sequence Stars using Machine Learning techniques","The Hubble Tarantula Treasury Project (HTTP) has provided an unprecedented
photometric coverage of the entire star-burst region of 30 Doradus down to the
half Solar mass limit. We use the deep stellar catalogue of HTTP to identify
all the pre--main-sequence (PMS) stars of the region, i.e., stars that have not
started their lives on the main-sequence yet. The photometric distinction of
these stars from the more evolved populations is not a trivial task due to
several factors that alter their colour-magnitude diagram positions. The
identification of PMS stars requires, thus, sophisticated statistical methods.
We employ Machine Learning Classification techniques on the HTTP survey of more
than 800,000 sources to identify the PMS stellar content of the observed field.
Our methodology consists of 1) carefully selecting the most probable low-mass
PMS stellar population of the star-forming cluster NGC 2070, 2) using this
sample to train classification algorithms to build a predictive model for PMS
stars, and 3) applying this model in order to identify the most probable PMS
content across the entire Tarantula Nebula. We employ Decision Tree, Random
Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers to categorise the stars as PMS
and Non-PMS. The Random Forest and Support Vector Machine provided the most
accurate models, predicting about 20,000 sources with a candidateship
probability higher than 50 percent, and almost 10,000 PMS candidates with a
probability higher than 95 percent. This is the richest and most accurate
photometric catalogue of extragalactic PMS candidates across the extent of a
whole star-forming complex.",2018-05-18T11:50:02Z
"Classification of OGLE eclipsing binary stars based on their morphology
  type with Locally Linear Embedding","The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) continuously monitors
hundreds of thousands of eclipsing binaries in the field of galactic bulge and
the Magellanic Clouds. These objects have been classified into main
morphological sub-classes, such as contact, non-contact, ellipsoidal and
cataclysmic variables, both by matching the light curves with predefined
templates and visual inspections. Here we present the result of a machine
learned automatic classification based on the morphology of light curves
inspired by the classification of eclipsing binaries observed by the original
Kepler mission. We similarly use a dimensionality reduction technique, the
locally linear embedding to map the high dimension of the data set into a low
dimensional embedding parameter space, while keeping the local geometry and the
similarities of the neighbouring data points. After three consecutive steps, we
assign one parameter to each binary star, which well scales with the
""detachness"", i.e. the sum of the relative radii of the components. This value
is in good agreement with the morphology types listed in the OGLE catalog and,
along with the orbital periods, can be used to filter any morphological
sub-types based on the similarity of light curves. Our open-source pipeline can
be applied in a fully automatic way to any other large data set to classify
binary stars.",2021-06-02T09:25:46Z
"Improved Selection Criteria for HII Regions, based on IRAS Sources","We present new criteria for selecting HII regions from the Infrared
Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) Point Source catalogue (PSC), based on an HII
region catalogue derived manually from the all-sky Wide-field Infrared Survey
Explorer (WISE). The criteria are used to augment the number of HII region
candidates in the Milky Way. The criteria are defined by the linear decision
boundary of two samples: IRAS point sources associated with known HII regions,
which serve as the HII region sample, and IRAS point sources at high Galactic
latitudes, which serve as the non-HII region sample. A machine learning
classifier, specifically a support vector machine (SVM), is used to determine
the decision boundary. We investigate all combinations of four IRAS bands and
suggest that the optimal criterion is log(F$_{\rm 60}$/F$_{\rm
12}$)$\ge$(-0.19$\times$log(F$_{\rm 100}$/F$_{\rm 25}$)+ 1.52), with detections
at 60 and 100 micron. This selects 3041 HII region candidates from the IRAS
PSC. We find that IRAS HII region candidates show evidence of evolution on the
two-colour diagram. Merging the WISE HII catalogue with IRAS HII region
candidates, we estimate a lower limit of approximately 10200 for the number of
HII regions in the Milky Way.",2018-02-23T00:40:07Z
"Leveraging the Mathematics of Shape for Solar Magnetic Eruption
  Prediction","Current operational forecasts of solar eruptions are made by human experts
using a combination of qualitative shape-based classification systems and
historical data about flaring frequencies. In the past decade, there has been a
great deal of interest in crafting machine-learning (ML) flare-prediction
methods to extract underlying patterns from a training set---e.g., a set of
solar magnetogram images, each characterized by features derived from the
magnetic field and labeled as to whether it was an eruption precursor. These
patterns, captured by various methods (neural nets, support vector machines,
etc.), can then be used to classify new images. A major challenge with any ML
method is the \textit{featurization} of the data: pre-processing the raw images
to extract higher-level properties, such as characteristics of the magnetic
field, that can streamline the training and use of these methods. It is key to
choose features that are informative, from the standpoint of the task at hand.
To date, the majority of ML-based solar eruption methods have used
physics-based magnetic and electric field features such as the total unsigned
magnetic flux, the gradients of the fields, the vertical current density, etc.
In this paper, we extend the relevant feature set to include characteristics of
the magnetic field that are based purely on the geometry and topology of 2D
magnetogram images and show that this improves the prediction accuracy of a
neural-net based flare-prediction method.",2020-03-12T14:54:24Z
"Analysis of SEP events and their possible precursors based on the GSEP
  Catalog","Solar energetic particle (SEP) events are one of the most crucial aspects of
space weather. Their prediction depends on various factors including the source
solar eruptions such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The
Geostationary Solar Energetic Particle (GSEP) Events catalog was developed as
an extensive data set towards this effort for solar cycles 22, 23 and 24. In
the present work, we review and extend the GSEP data set by; (1) adding ""weak""
SEP events that have proton enhancements from 0.5 to 10 pfu in the E>10 MeV
channel, and (2) improving the associated solar source eruptions information.
We analyze and discuss spatio-temporal properties such as flare magnitudes,
locations, rise times, and speed and width of CMEs. We check for the
correlation of these parameters with peak proton fluxes and event fluences. Our
study also focuses on understanding feature importance towards the optimal
performance of machine learning (ML) models for SEP event forecasting. We
implement random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), logistic
regression (LR) and support vector machines (SVM) classifiers in a binary
classification schema. Based on the evaluation of our best models, we find both
the flare and CME parameters are requisites to predict the occurrence of an SEP
event. This work is a foundation for our further efforts on SEP event
forecasting using robust ML methods.",2023-06-20T06:28:26Z
"Ask The Machine: Systematic detection of wind-type outflows in low-mass
  X-ray binaries","The systematic discovery of outflows in the optical spectra of low-mass X-ray
binaries opened a new avenue for the study of the outburst evolution in these
extreme systems. However, the efficient detection of such features in a
continuously growing database requires the development of new analysis
techniques with a particular focus on scalability, adaptability, and
automatization. In this pilot study, we explore the use of machine learning
algorithms to perform the identification of outflows in spectral line profiles
observed in the optical range. We train and test the classifier on a simulated
database, constructed through a combination of disc emission line profiles and
outflow signatures, emulating typical observations of low-mass X-ray binaries.
The final, trained classifier is applied to two sets of spectra taken during
two bright outbursts that were particularly well covered, those of V404 Cyg
(2015) and MAXI J1820+070 (2018). The resulting classification gained by this
novel approach is overall consistent with that obtained through traditional
techniques, while it simultaneously provides a number of key advantages over
the latter, including the access to low velocity outflows. This study sets the
foundations for future studies on large samples of spectra from low-mass X-ray
binaries and other compact binaries.",2023-06-21T18:00:02Z
"Discovery of Bright Galactic R Coronae Borealis and DY Persei Variables:
  Rare Gems Mined from ACVS","We present the results of a machine-learning (ML) based search for new R
Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars and DY Persei-like stars (DYPers) in the Galaxy
using cataloged light curves from the All-Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) Catalog
of Variable Stars (ACVS). RCB stars - a rare class of hydrogen-deficient
carbon-rich supergiants - are of great interest owing to the insights they can
provide on the late stages of stellar evolution. DYPers are possibly the
low-temperature, low-luminosity analogs to the RCB phenomenon, though
additional examples are needed to fully establish this connection. While RCB
stars and DYPers are traditionally identified by epochs of extreme dimming that
occur without regularity, the ML search framework more fully captures the
richness and diversity of their photometric behavior. We demonstrate that our
ML method can use newly discovered RCB stars to identify additional candidates
within the same data set. Our search yields 15 candidates that we consider
likely RCB stars/DYPers: new spectroscopic observations confirm that four of
these candidates are RCB stars and four are DYPers. Our discovery of four new
DYPers increases the number of known Galactic DYPers from two to six;
noteworthy is that one of the new DYPers has a measured parallax and is m ~ 7
mag, making it the brightest known DYPer to date. Future observations of these
new DYPers should prove instrumental in establishing the RCB connection. We
consider these results, derived from a machine-learned probabilistic
classification catalog, as an important proof-of-concept for the efficient
discovery of rare sources with time-domain surveys.",2012-04-18T20:00:00Z
"A Machine Learning Method to Infer Fundamental Stellar Parameters from
  Photometric Light Curves","A fundamental challenge for wide-field imaging surveys is obtaining follow-up
spectroscopic observations: there are > $10^9$ photometrically cataloged
sources, yet modern spectroscopic surveys are limited to ~few x $10^6$ targets.
As we approach the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) era, new algorithmic
solutions are required to cope with the data deluge. Here we report the
development of a machine-learning framework capable of inferring fundamental
stellar parameters (Teff, log g, and [Fe/H]) using photometric-brightness
variations and color alone. A training set is constructed from a systematic
spectroscopic survey of variables with Hectospec/MMT. In sum, the training set
includes ~9000 spectra, for which stellar parameters are measured using the
SEGUE Stellar Parameters Pipeline (SSPP). We employed the random forest
algorithm to perform a non-parametric regression that predicts Teff, log g, and
[Fe/H] from photometric time-domain observations. Our final, optimized model
produces a cross-validated root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 165 K, 0.39 dex,
and 0.33 dex for Teff, log g, and [Fe/H], respectively. Examining the subset of
sources for which the SSPP measurements are most reliable, the RMSE reduces to
125 K, 0.37 dex, and 0.27 dex, respectively, comparable to what is achievable
via low-resolution spectroscopy. For variable stars this represents a ~12-20%
improvement in RMSE relative to models trained with single-epoch photometric
colors. As an application of our method, we estimate stellar parameters for
~54,000 known variables. We argue that this method may convert photometric
time-domain surveys into pseudo-spectrographic engines, enabling the
construction of extremely detailed maps of the Milky Way, its structure, and
history.",2014-11-04T21:00:49Z
"Gaia eclipsing binary and multiple systems. Supervised classification
  and self-organizing maps","Large surveys producing tera- and petabyte-scale databases require
machine-learning and knowledge discovery methods to deal with the overwhelming
quantity of data and the difficulties of extracting concise, meaningful
information with reliable assessment of its uncertainty. This study
investigates the potential of a few machine-learning methods for the automated
analysis of eclipsing binaries in the data of such surveys. We aim to aid the
extraction of samples of eclipsing binaries from such databases and to provide
basic information about the objects. We estimate class labels according to two
classification systems, one based on the light curve morphology (EA/EB/EW
classes) and the other based on the physical characteristics of the binary
system (system morphology classes; detached through overcontact systems).
Furthermore, we explore low-dimensional surfaces along which the light curves
of eclipsing binaries are concentrated, to use in the characterization of the
binary systems and in the exploration of biases of the full unknown Gaia data
with respect to the training sets. We explore the performance of principal
component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), random forest
classification and self-organizing maps (SOM). We pre-process the photometric
time series by combining a double Gaussian profile fit and a smoothing spline,
in order to de-noise and interpolate the observed light curves. We achieve
further denoising, and selected the most important variability elements from
the light curves using PCA. We perform supervised classification using random
forest and LDA based on the PC decomposition, while SOM gives a continuous
2-dimensional manifold of the light curves arranged by a few important
features. We estimate the uncertainty of the supervised methods due to the
specific finite training set using ensembles of models constructed on
randomized training sets.",2017-02-21T09:04:02Z
"A Near-infrared RR Lyrae census along the southern Galactic plane: the
  Milky Way's stellar fossil brought to light","RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) are tracers of the Milky Way's fossil record, holding
valuable information on its formation and early evolution. Owing to the high
interstellar extinction endemic to the Galactic plane, distant RRLs lying at
low Galactic latitudes have been elusive. We attained a census of 1892
high-confidence RRLs by exploiting the near-infrared photometric database of
the VVV survey's disk footprint spanning $\sim$70$^\circ$ of Galactic
longitude, using a machine-learned classifier. Novel data-driven methods were
employed to accurately characterize their spatial distribution using sparsely
sampled multi-band photometry. The RRL metallicity distribution function (MDF)
was derived from their $K_s$-band light curve parameters using machine-learning
methods. The MDF shows remarkable structural similarities to both the
spectroscopic MDF of red clump giants and the MDF of bulge RRLs. We model the
MDF with a multi-component density distribution and find that the number
density of stars associated with the different model components systematically
changes with both the Galactocentric radius and vertical distance from the
Galactic plane, equivalent to weak metallicity gradients. Based on the
consistency with results from the ARGOS survey, three MDF modes are attributed
to the old disk populations, while the most metal-poor RRLs are probably halo
interlopers. We propose that the dominant [Fe/H] component with a mean of $-1$
dex might correspond to the outskirts of an ancient Galactic spheroid or
classical bulge component residing in the central Milky Way. The physical
origins of the RRLs in this study need to be verified by kinematical
information.",2018-04-04T15:11:04Z
"Supervised Machine Learning for Intercomparison of Model Grids of Brown
  Dwarfs: Application to GJ 570D and the Epsilon Indi B Binary System","Self-consistent model grids of brown dwarfs involve complex physics and
chemistry, and are often computed using proprietary computer codes, making it
challenging to identify the reasons for discrepancies between model and data as
well as between the models produced by different research groups. In the
current study, we demonstrate a novel method for analyzing brown dwarf spectra,
which combines the use of the Sonora, AMES-Cond and HELIOS model grids with the
supervised machine learning method of the random forest. Besides performing
atmospheric retrieval, the random forest enables information content analysis
of the three model grids as a natural outcome of the method, both individually
on each grid and by comparing the grids against one another, via computing
large suites of mock retrievals. Our analysis reveals that the different
choices made in modelling the alkali line shapes hinder the use of the alkali
lines as gravity indicators. Nevertheless, the spectrum longward of 1.2 micron
encodes enough information on the surface gravity to allow its inference from
retrieval. Temperature may be accurately and precisely inferred independent of
the choice of model grid, but not the surface gravity. We apply random forest
retrieval to three objects: the benchmark T7.5 brown dwarf GJ 570D; and Epsilon
Indi Ba (T1.5 brown dwarf) and Bb (T6 brown dwarf), which are part of a binary
system and have measured dynamical masses. For GJ 570D, the inferred effective
temperature and surface gravity are consistent with previous studies. For
Epsilon Indi Ba and Bb, the inferred surface gravities are broadly consistent
with the values informed by the dynamical masses.",2019-10-25T15:23:25Z
"UOCS. III. UVIT catalogue of open clusters with machine learning based
  membership using \textit{Gaia} EDR3 astrometry","We present a study of six open clusters (Berkeley 67, King 2, NGC 2420, NGC
2477, NGC 2682 and NGC 6940) using the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT)
aboard \textit{ASTROSAT} and \textit{Gaia} EDR3. We used combinations of
astrometric, photometric and systematic parameters to train and supervise a
machine learning algorithm along with a Gaussian mixture model for the
determination of cluster membership. This technique is robust, reproducible and
versatile in various cluster environments. In this study, the \textit{Gaia}
EDR3 membership catalogues are provided along with classification of the stars
as \texttt{members, candidates} and \texttt{field} in the six clusters. We
could detect 200--2500 additional members using our method with respect to
previous studies, which helped estimate mean space velocities, distances,
number of members and core radii. UVIT photometric catalogues, which include
blue stragglers, main-sequence and red giants are also provided. From
UV--Optical colour-magnitude diagrams, we found that majority of the sources in
NGC 2682 and a few in NGC 2420, NGC 2477 and NGC 6940 showed excess UV flux.
NGC 2682 images have ten white dwarf detection in far-UV. The far-UV and
near-UV images of the massive cluster NGC 2477 have 92 and 576 \texttt{members}
respectively, which will be useful to study the UV properties of stars in the
extended turn-off and in various evolutionary stages from main-sequence to red
clump. Future studies will carry out panchromatic and spectroscopic analysis of
noteworthy members detected in this study.",2021-01-18T15:26:18Z
"The GALAH Survey: A New Sample of Extremely Metal-Poor Stars Using A
  Machine Learning Classification Algorithm","Extremely Metal-Poor (EMP) stars provide a valuable probe of early chemical
enrichment in the Milky Way. Here we leverage a large sample of $\sim600,000$
high-resolution stellar spectra from the GALAH survey plus a machine learning
algorithm to find 54 candidates with estimated [Fe/H]~$\leq$~-3.0, 6 of which
have [Fe/H]~$\leq$~-3.5. Our sample includes $\sim 20 \%$ main sequence EMP
candidates, unusually high for \emp surveys. We find the magnitude-limited
metallicity distribution function of our sample is consistent with previous
work that used more complex selection criteria. The method we present has
significant potential for application to the next generation of massive stellar
spectroscopic surveys, which will expand the available spectroscopic data well
into the millions of stars.",2022-03-21T10:05:08Z
J-PLUS: Support Vector Regression to Measure Stellar Parameters,"Context. Stellar parameters are among the most important characteristics in
studies of stars, which are based on atmosphere models in traditional methods.
However, time cost and brightness limits restrain the efficiency of spectral
observations. The J-PLUS is an observational campaign that aims to obtain
photometry in 12 bands. Owing to its characteristics, J-PLUS data have become a
valuable resource for studies of stars. Machine learning provides powerful
tools to efficiently analyse large data sets, such as the one from J-PLUS, and
enable us to expand the research domain to stellar parameters. Aims. The main
goal of this study is to construct a SVR algorithm to estimate stellar
parameters of the stars in the first data release of the J-PLUS observational
campaign. Methods. The training data for the parameters regressions is featured
with 12-waveband photometry from J-PLUS, and is cross-identified with
spectrum-based catalogs. These catalogs are from the LAMOST, the APOGEE, and
the SEGUE. We then label them with the stellar effective temperature, the
surface gravity and the metallicity. Ten percent of the sample is held out to
apply a blind test. We develop a new method, a multi-model approach in order to
fully take into account the uncertainties of both the magnitudes and stellar
parameters. The method utilizes more than two hundred models to apply the
uncertainty analysis. Results. We present a catalog of 2,493,424 stars with the
Root Mean Square Error of 160K in the effective temperature regression, 0.35 in
the surface gravity regression and 0.25 in the metallicity regression. We also
discuss the advantages of this multi-model approach and compare it to other
machine-learning methods.",2022-05-05T12:11:20Z
"Massive young stellar objects in the Local Group spiral galaxy M33
  identified using machine learning","We present a supervised machine learning classification of stellar
populations in the Local Group spiral galaxy M\,33. The Probabilistic Random
Forest (PRF) methodology, previously applied to populations in NGC\,6822,
utilises both near and far-IR classification features. It classifies sources
into nine target classes: young stellar objects (YSOs), oxygen- and carbon-rich
asymptotic giant branch stars, red giant branch and red super-giant stars,
active galactic nuclei, blue stars (e.g. O-, B- and A-type main sequence
stars), Wolf-Rayet stars and Galactic foreground stars. Across 100
classification runs the PRF classified 162,746 sources with an average
estimated accuracy of $\sim$\,86\,per\,cent, based on confusion matrices. We
identified 4985 YSOs across the disk of M\,33, applying a density-based
clustering analysis to identify 68 star forming regions (SFRs) primarily in the
galaxy's spiral arms. SFR counterparts to known H\,{\sc ii} regions were
recovered, with $\sim$\,91\,per\,cent of SFRs spatially coincident with giant
molecular clouds identified in the literature. Using photometric measurements,
as well as SFRs in NGC\,6822 with an established evolutionary sequence as a
benchmark, we employed a novel approach combining ratios of
[H$\alpha$]$/$[24$\mu$m] and [250$\mu$m]$/$[500$\mu$m] to estimate the relative
evolutionary status of all M\,33 SFRs. Masses were estimated for each YSO
ranging from 6\,$-$\,27\,M$_\odot$. Using these masses, we estimate star
formation rates based on direct YSO counts of 0.63\,M$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$ in
M\,33's SFRs, 0.79\,$\pm$\,0.16\,M$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$ in its centre and
1.42\,$\pm$\,0.16\,M$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$ globally.",2022-09-21T14:03:41Z
"NGTS clusters survey IV. Search for Dipper stars in the Orion Nebular
  Cluster","The dipper is a novel class of young stellar object associated with large
drops in flux on the order of 10 to 50 per cent lasting for hours to days. Too
significant to arise from intrinsic stellar variability, these flux drops are
currently attributed to disk warps, accretion streams, and/or transiting
circumstellar dust. Dippers have been previously studied in young star forming
regions including the Orion Complex. Using Next Generation Transit Survey
(NGTS) data, we identified variable stars from their lightcurves. We then
applied a machine learning random forest classifier for the identification of
new dipper stars in Orion using previous variable classifications as a training
set. We discover 120 new dippers, of which 83 are known members of the Complex.
We also investigated the occurrence rate of disks in our targets, again using a
machine learning approach. We find that all dippers have disks, and most of
these are full disks. We use dipper periodicity and model-derived stellar
masses to identify the orbital distance to the inner disk edge for dipper
objects, confirming that dipper stars exhibit strongly extended sublimation
radii, adding weight to arguments that the inner disk edge is further out than
predicted by simple models. Finally, we determine a dipper fraction (the
fraction of stars with disks which are dippers) for known members of 27.8 plus
minus 2.9 per cent. Our findings represent the largest population of dippers
identified in a single cluster to date.",2023-04-19T19:38:27Z
"Cataclysmic variables from Sloan Digital Sky Survey -- V (2020-2023)
  identified using machine learning","SDSS-V is carrying out a dedicated survey for white dwarfs, single and in
binaries, and we report the analysis of the spectroscopy of 505 cataclysmic
variables (CVs) and CV candidates obtained during the first 34 months of
observations of SDSS-V. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to
aid with the identification of CV candidates among the over 2 million SDSS-V
spectra obtained with the BOSS spectrograph. The CNN reduced the number of
spectra that required visual inspection to $\simeq2$ per cent of the total. We
identified 779 CV spectra among the CNN-selected candidates, plus an additional
37 CV spectra that the CNN misclassified, but that were found serendipitously
by human inspection of the data. Analysing the SDSS-V spectroscopy and
ancillary data of the 505 CVs in our sample, we report 62 new CVs,
spectroscopically confirm 243 and refute 13 published CV candidates, and we
report 68 new or improved orbital periods. We discuss the completeness and
possible selection biases of the machine learning methodology, as well as the
effectiveness of targeting CV candidates within SDSS-V. Finally, we re-assess
the space density of CVs, and find $1.3\times 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{pc^{-3}}$.",2024-06-27T18:00:24Z
"Data-driven stellar intrinsic colors and dust reddenings for
  spectro-photometric data: From the blue-edge method to a machine-learning
  approach","Intrinsic colors (ICs) of stars are essential for the studies on both stellar
physics and dust reddening. In this work, we developed an XGBoost model to
predict the ICs with the atmospheric parameters $T_{\rm eff}$, ${\rm log}\,g$,
and $\rm [M/H]$. The model was trained and tested for three colors at Gaia and
2MASS bands with 1,040,446 low-reddening sources. The atmospheric parameters
were determined by the Gaia DR3 GSP-phot module and were validated by comparing
with APOGEE and LAMOST. We further confirmed that the biases in GSP-phot
parameters, especially for $\rm [M/H]$, do not present a significant impact on
the IC prediction. The generalization error of the model estimated by the test
set is 0.014 mag for $(G_{\rm BP}\,{-}\,G_{\rm RP})_0$, 0.050 mag for $(G_{\rm
BP}\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})_0$, and 0.040 mag for $(J\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})_0$. The model
was applied to a sample containing 5,714,528 reddened stars with stellar
parameters from Andrae et al. (2023) to calculate ICs and reddenings. The high
consistency in the comparison of $E(J\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})$ between our results and
literature values further validates the accuracy of the XGBoost model. The
variation of $E(G_{\rm BP}\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})/E(G_{\rm BP}\,{-}\,G_{\rm RP})$, a
representation of the extinction law, with Galactic longitude is found on large
scales. This work preliminarily presents the feasibility and the accuracy of
the machine-learning approach for IC and dust reddening calculation, whose
products could be widely applied to spectro-photometric data. The data sets and
trained model can be accessed via
\url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12787594}. The models for more bands will
be completed in the following works.",2024-07-24T16:11:28Z
On the Relationship Between Debris Disks and Planets,"Dust in debris disks is generated by collisions among planetesimals. The
existence of these planetesimals is a consequence of the planet formation
process, but the relationship between debris disks and planets has not been
clearly established. Here we analyze Spitzer/MIPS 24 and 70 micrometer data for
150 planet-bearing stars, and compare the incidence of debris disks around
these stars with a sample of 118 stars around which planets have been searched
for, but not found. Together they comprise the largest sample ever assembled to
deal with this question. The use of survival analysis techniques allows us to
account for the large number of non-detections at 70 micrometer. We discovered
10 new debris disks around stars with planets and one around a star without
known planets. We found that the incidence of debris disks is marginally higher
among stars with planets, than among those without, and that the brightness of
the average debris disk is not significantly different in the two samples. We
conclude that the presence of a planet that has been detected via current
radial velocity techniques is not a good predictor of the presence of a debris
disk detected at infrared wavelengths.",2009-06-30T21:36:08Z
"Recent Developments of NEMO: Detection of Solar Eruptions
  Characteristics","The recent developments in space instrumentation for solar observations and
telemetry have caused the necessity of advanced pattern recognition tools for
the different classes of solar events. The Extreme ultraviolet Imaging
Telescope (EIT) of solar corona on-board SOHO spacecraft has uncovered a new
class of eruptive events which are often identified as signatures of Coronal
Mass Ejection (CME) initiations on solar disk. It is evident that a crucial
task is the development of an automatic detection tool of CMEs precursors. The
Novel EIT wave Machine Observing (NEMO) (http://sidc.be/nemo) code is an
operational tool that detects automatically solar eruptions using EIT image
sequences. NEMO applies techniques based on the general statistical properties
of the underlying physical mechanisms of eruptive events on the solar disc. In
this work, the most recent updates of NEMO code - that have resulted to the
increase of the recognition efficiency of solar eruptions linked to CMEs - are
presented. These updates provide calculations of the surface of the dimming
region, implement novel clustering technique for the dimmings and set new
criteria to flag the eruptive dimmings based on their complex characteristics.
The efficiency of NEMO has been increased significantly resulting to the
extraction of dimmings observed near the solar limb and to the detection of
small-scale events as well. As a consequence, the detection efficiency of CMEs
precursors and the forecasts of CMEs have been drastically improved.
Furthermore, the catalogues of solar eruptive events that can be constructed by
NEMO may include larger number of physical parameters associated to the dimming
regions.",2011-03-23T21:35:33Z
"Characterizing the Cool Kepler Objects of Interest. New Effective
  Temperatures, Metallicities, Masses and Radii of Low-Mass Kepler
  Planet-Candidate Host Stars","We report stellar parameters for late-K and M-type planet-candidate host
stars announced by the Kepler Mission. We obtained medium-resolution, K-band
spectra of 84 cool (Teff < 4400 K) Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) from
Borucki et al. We identified one object as a giant (KOI 977); for the remaining
dwarfs, we measured effective temperatures (Teff) and metallicities ([M/H])
using the K-band spectral indices of Rojas-Ayala et al. We determine the masses
and radii of the cool KOIs by interpolation onto the Dartmouth evolutionary
isochrones. The resultant stellar radii are significantly less than the values
reported in the Kepler Input Catalogue and, by construction, correlate better
with Teff. Applying the published KOI transit parameters to our stellar radius
measurements, we report new physical radii for the planet candidates.
Recalculating the equilibrium temperatures of the planet-candidates assuming
Earth's albedo and re-radiation fraction, we find that 3 of the
planet-candidates are terrestrial-sized with orbital semi-major axes that lie
within the habitable zones of their host stars (KOI 463.01, KOI 812.03 and KOI
854.01). The stellar parameters presented in this letter serve as a resource
for prioritization of future follow-up efforts to validate and characterize the
cool KOI planet candidates.",2011-09-08T20:00:00Z
"An Automatic Method for Extreme-Ultraviolet Dimmings Associated with
  Small-Scale Eruption","Small-scale extreme ultraviolet (EUV) dimming often surrounds sites of energy
release in the quiet Sun. This paper describes a method for the automatic
detection of these small-scale EUV dimmings using a feature based classifier.
The method is demonstrated using sequences of 171 A images taken by STEREO/EUVI
on 13 June 2007 and by SDO/AIA on 27 August 2010. The feature identification
relies on recognizing structure in sequences of space-time 171\AA\ images using
the Zernike moments of the images. The Zernike moments space-time slices with
events and non-events are distinctive enough to be separated using a Support
Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The SVM is trained using 150 event and 700
non-event space-time slices. We find a total of 1217 events in the EUVI images
and 2064 events in the AIA images on the days studied. Most of the events are
found between latitudes -35 degree and +35 degree. The sizes and expansion
speeds of central dimming regions are extracted using a region grow algorithm.
The histograms of the sizes in both EUVI and AIA follow a steep power law with
slope about -5. The AIA slope extends to smaller sizes before turning over. The
mean velocity of 1325 dimming regions seen by AIA is found to be about 14 km/s.",2011-12-20T13:24:09Z
"Discovery of a young and massive stellar cluster: Spectrophotometric
  near-infrared study of Masgomas-1","Context: Recent near-infrared data have contributed to the discovery of new
(obscured) massive stellar clusters and massive stellar populations in
previously known clusters in our Galaxy. These discoveries lead us to view the
Milky Way as an active star-forming machine.
  Aims: The main purpose of this work is to determine physically the main
parameters (distance, size, total mass and age) of Masgomas-1, the first
massive cluster discovered by our systematic search programme.
  Methods: Using near-infrared (J, H, and Ks) photometry we selected 23 OB-type
and five red supergiant candidates for multi-object H- and K-spectroscopy and
spectral classification.
  Results: Of the 28 spectroscopically observed stars, 17 were classified as
OB-type, four as supergiants, one as an A-type dwarf star, and six as late-type
giant stars. The presence of a supergiant population implies a massive nature
of Masgomas-1, supported by our estimate of the cluster initial total mass of
(1.94\pm0.28)\cdot10^4 M_{sun}, obtained after integrating of the cluster mass
function. The distance estimate of 3.53 kpc locates the cluster closer than the
Scutum--Centaurus base but still within that Galactic arm. The presence of an
O9V star and red supergiants in the same population indicates that the cluster
age is in the range of 8 to 10 Myr.",2012-03-19T17:18:28Z
Measuring the rotation period distribution of field M-dwarfs with Kepler,"We have analysed 10 months of public data from the Kepler space mission to
measure rotation periods of main-sequence stars with masses between 0.3 and
0.55 M_sun. To derive the rotational period we introduce the autocorrelation
function and show that it is robust against phase and amplitude modulation and
residual instrumental systematics. Of the 2483 stars examined, we detected
rotation periods in 1570 (63.2%), representing an increase of a factor ~ 30 in
the number of rotation period determination for field M-dwarfs. The periods
range from 0.37-69.7 days, with amplitudes ranging from 1.0-140.8 mmags. The
rotation period distribution is clearly bimodal, with peaks at ~ 19 and ~ 33
days, hinting at two distinct waves of star formation, a hypothesis that is
supported by the fact that slower rotators tend to have larger proper motions.
The two peaks of the rotation period distribution form two distinct sequences
in period-temperature space, with the period decreasing with increasing
temperature, reminiscent of the Vaughan-Preston gap. The period-mass
distribution of our sample shows no evidence of a transition at the fully
convective boundary. On the other hand, the slope of the upper envelope of the
period-mass relation changes sign around 0.55 M_sun, below which period rises
with decreasing mass.",2013-03-27T10:56:19Z
"An observational correlation between stellar brightness variations and
  surface gravity","Surface gravity is one of a star's basic properties, but it is difficult to
measure accurately, with typical uncertainties of 25-50 per cent if measured
spectroscopically and 90-150 per cent photometrically. Asteroseismology
measures gravity with an uncertainty of about two per cent but is restricted to
relatively small samples of bright stars, most of which are giants. The
availability of high-precision measurements of brightness variations for
>150,000 stars provides an opportunity to investigate whether the variations
can be used to determine surface gravities. The Fourier power of granulation on
a star's surface correlates physically with surface gravity; if brightness
variations on timescales of hours arise from granulation, then such variations
should correlate with surface gravity. Here we report an analysis of archival
data that reveals an observational correlation between surface gravity and the
root-mean-square brightness variations on timescales of less than eight hours
for stars with temperatures of 4500-6750K, log of surface gravities of 2.5-4.5
(cgs units), and having overall brightness variations <3 parts per thousand. A
straightforward observation of optical brightness variations therefore allows a

Measurements of Absolute Abundances in Solar Flares,"We present measurements of elemental abundances in solar flares with the EUV
Variability Experiment (EVE) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). EVE
observes both high temperature Fe emission lines (Fe XV-Fe XXIV) and continuum
emission from thermal bremsstrahlung that is proportional to the abundance of
H. By comparing the relative intensities of line and continuum emission it is
possible to determine the enrichment of the flare plasma relative to the
composition of the photosphere. This is the first ionization potential or FIP
bias ($f$). Since thermal bremsstrahlung at EUV wavelengths is relatively
insensitive to the electron temperature, it is important to account for the
distribution of electron temperatures in the emitting plasma. We accomplish
this by using the observed spectra to infer the differential emission measure
distribution and FIP bias simultaneously. In each of the 21 flares that we
analyze we find that the observed composition is close to photospheric. The
mean FIP bias in our sample is $f=1.27\pm0.23$. This analysis suggests that the
bulk of the plasma evaporated during a flare comes from deep in the
chromosphere, below the region where elemental fractionation occurs.",2013-10-17T16:28:20Z
"Rotational and Radial Velocities of 1.3-2.2 M_Sun Red Giants in Open
  Clusters","This study presents the rotational distribution of red giant stars (RGs) in
eleven old to intermediate age open clusters. The masses of these stars are all
above the Kraft break, so that they lose negligible amounts of their birth
angular momentum (AM) during the main sequence evolution. However, they do span
a mass range with quite different AM distributions imparted during formation,
with the stars less massive than ~1.6 M_Sun arriving on the main sequence with
lower rotation rates than the more massive stars. The majority of RGs in this
study are slow rotators across the entire red giant branch regardless of mass,
supporting the picture that intermediate mass stars rapidly spin down when they
evolve off the main sequence and develop convection zones capable of driving a
magnetic dynamo. Nevertheless, a small fraction of RGs in open clusters show
some level of enhanced rotation, and faster rotators are as common in these
clusters as in the field red giant population. Most of these enhanced rotators
appear to be red clump stars, which is also true of the underlying stellar
sample, while others are clearly RGs that are above or below the clump. In
addition to rotational velocities, the radial velocities and membership
probabilities of individual stars are also presented. Cluster heliocentric
radial velocities for NGC 6005 and Pismis 18 are reported for the first time.",2014-04-16T19:43:32Z
"A Hybrid Advection Scheme for Conserving Angular Momentum on a Refined
  Cartesian Mesh","We test a new ""hybrid"" scheme for simulating dynamical fluid flows in which
cylindrical components of the momentum are advected across a rotating Cartesian
coordinate mesh. This hybrid scheme allows us to conserve angular momentum to
machine precision while capitalizing on the advantages offered by a Cartesian
mesh, such as a straightforward implementation of mesh refinement. Our test
focuses on measuring the real and imaginary parts of the eigenfrequency of
unstable axisymmetric modes that naturally arise in massless polytropic tori
having a range of different aspect ratios, and quantifying the uncertainty in
these measurements. Our measured eigenfrequencies show good agreement with the
results obtained from the linear stability analysis of Kojima (1986) and from
nonlinear hydrodynamic simulations performed on a cylindrical coordinate mesh
by Woodward et al. (1994). When compared against results conducted with a
traditional Cartesian advection scheme, the hybrid scheme achieves qualitative
convergence at the same or, in some cases, much lower grid resolutions and
conserves angular momentum to a much higher degree of precision. As a result,
this hybrid scheme is much better suited for simulating astrophysical fluid
flows, such as accretion disks and mass-transferring binary systems.",2014-04-23T19:55:13Z
"YSOVAR: mid-infrared variability of young stellar objects and their
  disks in the cluster IRAS 20050+2720","We present a time-variability study of young stellar objects in the cluster
IRAS 20050+2720, performed at 3.6 and 4.5 micron with the Spitzer Space
Telescope; this study is part of the Young Stellar Object VARiability project
(YSOVAR). We have collected light curves for 181 cluster members over 40 days.
We find a high variability fraction among embedded cluster members of ca. 70%,
whereas young stars without a detectable disk display variability less often
(in ca. 50% of the cases) and with lower amplitudes. We detect periodic
variability for 33 sources with periods primarily in the range of 2-6 days.
Practically all embedded periodic sources display additional variability on top
of their periodicity. Furthermore, we analyze the slopes of the tracks that our
sources span in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD). We find that sources with
long variability time scales tend to display CMD slopes that are at least
partially influenced by accretion processes, while sources with short
variability time scales tend to display extinction-dominated slopes. We find a
tentative trend of X-ray detected cluster members to vary on longer time scales
than the X-ray undetected members.",2015-07-15T18:53:25Z
"Prediction of Solar Flare Size and Time-to-Flare Using Support Vector
  Machine Regression","We study the prediction of solar flare size and time-to-flare using 38
features describing magnetic complexity of the photospheric magnetic field.
This work uses support vector regression to formulate a mapping from the
38-dimensional feature space to a continuous-valued label vector representing
flare size or time-to-flare. When we consider flaring regions only, we find an
average error in estimating flare size of approximately half a
\emph{geostationary operational environmental satellite} (\emph{GOES}) class.
When we additionally consider non-flaring regions, we find an increased average
error of approximately 3/4 a \emph{GOES} class. We also consider thresholding
the regressed flare size for the experiment containing both flaring and
non-flaring regions and find a true positive rate of 0.69 and a true negative
rate of 0.86 for flare prediction. The results for both of these size
regression experiments are consistent across a wide range of predictive time
windows, indicating that the magnetic complexity features may be persistent in
appearance long before flare activity. This is supported by our larger error
rates of some 40 hr in the time-to-flare regression problem. The 38 magnetic
complexity features considered here appear to have discriminative potential for
flare size, but their persistence in time makes them less discriminative for
the time-to-flare problem.",2015-11-05T22:41:32Z
"Standard Galactic Field RR Lyrae. I. Optical to Mid-infrared Phased
  Photometry","We present a multi-wavelength compilation of new and previously-published
photometry for 55 Galactic field RR Lyrae variables. Individual studies,
spanning a time baseline of up to 30 years, are self-consistently phased to
produce light curves in 10 photometric bands covering the wavelength range from
0.4 to 4.5 microns. Data smoothing via the GLOESS technique is described and
applied to generate high-fidelity light curves, from which mean magnitudes,
amplitudes, rise-times, and times of minimum and maximum light are derived.
60,000 observations were acquired using the new robotic Three-hundred
MilliMeter Telescope (TMMT), which was first deployed at the Carnegie
Observatories in Pasadena, CA, and is now permanently installed and operating
at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. We provide a full description of the TMMT
hardware, software, and data reduction pipeline. Archival photometry
contributed approximately 31,000 observations. Photometric data are given in
the standard Johnson UBV, Kron-Cousins RI, 2MASS JHK, and Spitzer [3.6] & [4.5]
bandpasses.",2017-03-04T21:09:48Z
"Relationships Between Characteristics of the Line-of-Sight Magnetic
  Field and Solar Flare Forecasts","We analyze the relationship between the flare X-ray peak flux, and
characteristics of the Polarity Inversion Line (PIL) and Active Regions (AR),
derived from line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms. The PIL detection algorithm
based on a magnetogram segmentation procedure is applied for each AR with 1
hour cadence. The PIL and AR characteristics are associated with the AR flare
history and divided into flaring and non-flaring cases. Effectiveness of the
derived characteristics for flare forecasting is determined by the number of
non-flaring cases separated from flaring cases by a certain threshold, and by
their Fisher ranking score. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained
only on the PIL characteristics is used for the flare prediction. We have
obtained the following results: (1) the PIL characteristics are more effective
than global characteristics of ARs, (2) the highest True Skill Statistics (TSS)
values of 0.76$\pm$0.03 for $\geq$M1.0 flares and 0.84$\pm$0.07 for $\geq$X1.0
flares are obtained using the ""Sigmoid"" SVM kernel, (3) the TSS scores obtained
using only the LOS magnetograms are slightly lower than the scores obtained
using vector magnetograms, but significantly better than current expert-based
predictions, (4) for prediction of $\geq$M1.0 class flares 74.4 % of all cases,
and 91.2 % for $\geq$X1.0 class, can be pre-classified as negative with no
significant effect on the results, (5) the inclusion of global AR
characteristics does not improve the forecast. The study confirms the unique
role of the PIL region characteristics in the flare initiation process, and
demonstrate possibilities of flare forecasting using only the line-of-sight
magnetograms.",2017-04-11T17:05:23Z
"Multi-band photometry and spectroscopy of an all-sky sample of bright
  white dwarfs","The upcoming NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will obtain
space-based uninterrupted light curves for a large sample of bright white
dwarfs distributed across the entire sky, providing a very rich resource for
asteroseismological studies and the search for transits from planetary debris.
We have compiled an all-sky catalogue of ultraviolet, optical, and infrared
photometry as well as proper motions, which we propose as an essential tool for
the preliminary identification and characterisation of potential targets. We
present data for 1864 known white dwarfs and 305 high-probability white dwarf
candidates brighter than 17 mag. We describe the spectroscopic follow-up of 135
stars, of which 82 are white dwarfs and 25 are hot subdwarfs. The new confirmed
stars include six pulsating white dwarf candidates (ZZ Cetis), and nine white
dwarf binaries with a cool main-sequence companion. We identify one star with a
spectroscopic distance of only 25 pc from the Sun. Around the time TESS is
launched, we foresee that all white dwarfs in this sample will have
trigonometric parallaxes measured by the ESA Gaia mission next year.",2017-08-30T18:00:02Z
Some Turbulent Predictions for Parker Solar Probe,"From the the solar photosphere to the outer heliosphere, the Sun's plasma
properties are fluctuating with a broad range of temporal and spatial scales.
In fact, a turbulent cascade of energy from large to small scales is a
frequently invoked explanation for heating the corona and accelerating the
solar wind. NASA's Parker Solar Probe (PSP) is expected to revolutionize our
understanding of coronal heating and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence by
performing in situ sampling closer to the Sun than any other prior space
mission. This research note presents theoretical predictions for some
properties of MHD turbulence (e.g., spacecraft-frame power spectra and variance
anisotropies) in the regions to be explored by PSP. These results are derived
from a previously published semi-empirical model of coupled Alfvenic and
fast-mode turbulence in the fast solar wind. The primary reason for this
research note is to show how straightforward it can be to extract useful
predictions from existing theoretical models about measurable quantities that
were not even considered when creating the models initially. The variance
anisotropy, for example, may be an important quantity for distinguishing
between different theoretical models for coronal heating and solar wind
acceleration.",2018-08-28T18:19:13Z
"Solar flare forecasting from magnetic feature properties generated by
  Solar Monitor Active Region Tracker","We study the predictive capabilities of magnetic feature properties (MF)
generated by Solar Monitor Active Region Tracker (SMART) for solar flare
forecasting from two datasets: the full dataset of SMART detections from 1996
to 2010 that has been previously studied by Ahmed et al. (2011) and a subset of
that dataset which only includes detections that are NOAA active regions (ARs).
Main contributions: we use marginal relevance as a filter feature selection
method to identify most useful SMART MF properties for separating flaring from
non-flaring detections and logistic regression to derive classification rules
to predict future observations. For comparison, we employ a Random Forest,
Support Vector Machine and a set of Deep Neural Network models, as well as
Lasso for feature selection. Using the linear model with three features we
obtain significantly better results (TSS=0.84) to those reported by Ahmed et
al.(2011) for the full dataset of SMART detections. The same model produced
competitive results (TSS=0.67) for the dataset of SMART detections that are
NOAA ARs which can be compared to a broader section of flare forecasting
literature. We show that more complex models are not required for this data.",2018-12-06T16:42:37Z
"Magnetic Inflation and Stellar Mass. V. Intensification and saturation
  of M dwarf absorption lines with Rossby number","In young sun-like stars and field M dwarf stars, chromospheric and coronal
magnetic activity indicators such as H$\alpha$, X-ray and radio emission are
known to saturate with low Rossby number ($Ro \lesssim 0.1$), defined as the
ratio of rotation period to convective turnover time. The mechanism for the
saturation is unclear. In this paper, we use photospheric Ti I and Ca I
absorption lines in $Y$ band to investigate magnetic field strength in M dwarfs
for Rossby numbers between 0.01 and 1.0. The equivalent widths of the lines are
magnetically enhanced by photospheric spots, a global field or a combination of
the two. The equivalent widths behave qualitatively similar to the
chromospheric and coronal indicators: we see increasing equivalent widths
(increasing absorption) with decreasing $Ro$ and saturation of the equivalent
widths for $Ro \lesssim 0.1$. The majority of M dwarfs in this study are fully
convective. The results add to mounting evidence that the magnetic saturation
mechanism occurs at or beneath the stellar photosphere.",2019-12-02T19:00:00Z
"Automatic Method for Identifying Photospheric Bright Points and Granules
  Observed by Sunrise","In this study, we propose methods for the automatic detection of photospheric
features (bright points and granules) from ultra-violet (UV) radiation, using a
feature-based classifier. The methods use quiet-Sun observations at 214 nm and
525 nm images taken by Sunrise on 9 June 2009. The function of region growing
and mean shift procedure are applied to segment the bright points (BPs) and
granules, respectively. Zernike moments of each region are computed. The
Zernike moments of BPs, granules, and other features are distinctive enough to
be separated using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The size
distribution of BPs can be fitted with a power-law slope -1.5. The peak value
of granule sizes is found to be about 0.5 arcsec^2. The mean value of the
filling factor of BPs is 0.01, and for granules it is 0.51. There is a critical
scale for granules so that small granules with sizes smaller than 2.5 arcsec^2
cover a wide range of brightness, while the brightness of large granules
approaches unity. The mean value of BP brightness fluctuations is estimated to
be 1.2, while for granules it is 0.22. Mean values of the horizontal velocities
of an individual BP and an individual BP within the network were found to be
1.6 km/s and 0.9 km/s, respectively. We conclude that the effect of individual
BPs in releasing energy to the photosphere and maybe the upper layers is
stronger than what the individual BPs release into the network.",2014-07-09T12:02:50Z
Global Energetics of Solar Flares: IV. Coronal Mass Ejection Energetics,"This study entails the fourth part of a global flare energetics project, in
which the mass $m_{\mathrm{cme}}$, kinetic energy $E_{\mathrm{kin}}$, and the
gravitational potential energy $E_{\mathrm{grav}}$ of coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) is measured in 399 M and X-class flare events observed during the first
3.5 yrs of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission, using a new method
based on the EUV dimming effect. The EUV dimming is modeled in terms of a
radial adiabatic expansion process, which is fitted to the observed evolution
of the total emission measure of the CME source region. The model derives the
evolution of the mean electron density, the emission measure, the bulk plasma
expansion velocity, the mass, and the energy in the CME source region. The EUV
dimming method is truly complementary to the Thomson scattering method in white
light, which probes the CME evolution in the heliosphere at $r > 2 R_{\odot}$,
while the EUV dimming method tracks the CME launch in the corona. We compare
the CME parameters obtained in white light with the LASCO/C2 coronagraph with
those obtained from EUV dimming with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
onboard SDO for all identical events in both data sets. We investigate
correlations between CME parameters, the relative timing with flare parameters,
frequency occurrence distributions, and the energy partition between magnetic,
thermal, nonthermal, and CME energies. CME energies are found to be
systematically lower than the dissipated magnetic energies, which is consistent
with a magnetic origin of CMEs.",2016-05-16T21:05:18Z
"A diagnostic of coronal elemental behavior during the inverse FIP effect
  in solar flares","The solar corona shows a distinctive pattern of elemental abundances that is
different from that of the photosphere. Low first ionization potential (FIP)
elements are enhanced by factors of several. A similar effect is seen in the
atmospheres of some solar-like stars, while late type M stars show an inverse
FIP effect. This inverse effect was recently detected on the Sun during solar
flares, potentially allowing a very detailed look at the spatial and temporal
behavior that is not possible from stellar observations. A key question for
interpreting these measurements is whether both effects act solely on low FIP
elements (a true inverse effect predicted by some models), or whether the
inverse FIP effect arises because high FIP elements are enhanced. Here we
develop a new diagnostic that can discriminate between the two scenarios, based
on modeling of the radiated power loss, and applying the models to a numerical
hydrodynamic simulation of coronal loop cooling. We show that when low/high FIP
elements are depleted/enhanced, there is a significant difference in the
cooling lifetime of loops that is greatest at lower temperatures. We apply this
diagnostic to a post X1.8 flare loop arcade and inverse FIP region, and show
that for this event, low FIP elements are depleted. We discuss the results in
the context of stellar observations, and models of the FIP and inverse FIP
effect. We also provide the radiated power loss functions for the two inverse
FIP effect scenarios in machine readable form to facilitate further modeling.",2018-07-12T02:53:58Z
"Exploring the stellar rotation of early-type stars in the LAMOST
  Medium-Resolution Survey. I. Catalog","We derive stellar parameters and abundances (`stellar labels') of 40,034
late-B and A-type main-sequence stars extracted from the Large Sky Area
Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope Medium Resolution Survey
(LAMOST--MRS). The primary selection of our early-type sample was obtained from
LAMOST Data Release 7 based on spectral line indices. We employed the Stellar
LAbel Machine (SLAM) to derive their spectroscopic stellar parameters, drawing
on Kurucz spectral synthesis models with 6000 K $< T_\mathrm{eff} <$ 15,000 K
and $-1$ dex $< \mathrm{[M/H]} <$ 1 dex. For a signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim
60$, the cross-validated scatter is $\sim$75 K, 0.06 dex, 0.05 dex, and $\sim
3.5\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ for $T_\mathrm{eff}$, $\log g$, [M/H], and $v\sin i$,
respectively. A comparison with objects with prior, known stellar labels shows
great consistency for all stellar parameters, except for $\log g$. Although
this is an intrinsic caveat that comes from the MRS's narrow wavelength
coverage, it only has a minor effect on estimates of the stellar rotation rates
because of the decent spectral resolution and the profile-fitting method
employed. The masses and ages of our early-type sample stars were inferred from
non-rotating stellar evolution models. This paves the way for reviewing the
properties of stellar rotation distributions as a function of stellar mass and
age.",2021-08-03T00:05:04Z
"Application of the Thermodynamics of Radiation to Dyson Spheres as Work
  Extractors and Computational Engines, and their Observational Consequences","I apply the thermodynamics of radiation to Dyson spheres as machines that do
work or computation, and examine their observational consequences. I identify
four properties of Dyson spheres that complicate typical analyses: globally,
they may do no work in the usual sense; they use radiation as the source and
sink of energy; they accept radiation from a limited range of solid angle; and
they conserve energy flux globally. I consider three kinds of activities:
computation at the Landauer limit; dissipative activities, in which the energy
of a sphere's activities cascades into waste heat, as for a biosphere; and
""traditional"" work that leaves the sphere, such as radio emission. I apply the
Landsberg formalism to derive efficiency limits in all 3 cases, and show that
optical circulators provide an ""existence proof"" that greatly simplifies the
problem and allows the Landsberg limit to be plausibly approached. I find that
for computation and traditional work, there is little to no advantage to
nesting shells (as in a ""Matrioshka Brain""); that the optimal use of mass is
generally to make very small and hot Dyson spheres; that for ""complete"" Dyson
spheres we expect optical depths of several; and that in all cases the
Landsberg limit corresponds to a form of the Carnot limit. I explore how these
conclusions might change in the face of complications such as the sphere having
practical efficiencies below the Landsberg limit (using the endoreversible
limit as an example); no use of optical circulators; and swarms of materials
instead of shells.",2023-09-12T22:49:09Z
"Variability in Protoplanetary Nebulae: X. Multi-year Periods as an
  Indicator of Potential Binaries","New observations are presented of four evolved objects that display long,
multi-year variations in their light curves. These are interpreted as good
evidence of their binary nature, with the modulation caused by the barycenter
motion of the evolved star resulting in a periodic obscuration by a
circumbinary disk. Although protoplanetary nebulae (PPNe) commonly possess
bipolar nebulae, which are thought to be shaped by a binary companion, there
are very few PPNe in which a binary companion has been found. Three of the
objects in this study appear to be PPNe, IRAS 07253-2001, 08005-2356, and
17542-0603, with long periods of 5.2, 6.9, and 8.2 yrs, respectively. The
binary nature of IRAS 08005-2356 has recently been confirmed by a radial
velocity study. Two samples, one of PPNe and the other of post-AGB star
candidates, are investigated for further evidence on how common is a
long-period light curve variation. Both samples suggest such light variations
are not common. The fourth object, IRAS 20056+1834 (QY Sge), is an obscured RV
Tau variable of the RVb subclass, with a long period of 3.9 yrs and pulsation
periods of 102.9 and 51.5 days. The period of this object is seen to vary by
2%. Evidence is presented for a recent mass ejection in IRAS 17542-0603.",2023-11-21T21:42:29Z
"Extended stellar systems in the solar neighborhood. IV. Meingast 1: the
  most massive stellar stream in the solar neighborhood","Nearby stellar streams carry unique information on the dynamical evolution
and disruption of stellar systems in the Galaxy, the mass distribution in the
disk, and provide unique targets for planet formation and evolution studies. We
revisit the stream discovered in Meingast et al (2019) to search for new
members, using Gaia DR2 data and a machine learning approach. We use a bagging
classifier of one-class Support Vector Machines to perform a search in
positions and proper motions for new stream members. We use the variable
prediction frequency resulting from the multitude of classifiers to estimate a
stream membership criterion which we use to select high fidelity sources. We
use the HR diagram and the Cartesian velocity distribution as test and
validation tools. We find about 2000 stream members with high-fidelity, or
about an order of magnitude more than previously known, unveiling the stream's
population across the entire stellar mass spectrum, from B-stars to M-stars,
including white dwarfs. We find that, apart from being slightly more
metal-poor, the HRD of the stream is indistinguishable from that of the
Pleiades cluster. For the mass range at which we are mostly complete, $\sim$0.2
M$_\odot$ $ < $ M $ < $ $\sim$4 M$_\odot$, we find a normal IMF, allowing us to
estimate the total mass of stream to be about 2000 M$_\odot$, making this
relatively young stream by far the most massive known. In addition, we identify
several white dwarfs as potential stream members. The nearby Meingast 1 stream,
due to its richness, age, and distance, is a new fundamental laboratory for
star and planet formation and evolution studies for the poorly studied
gravitationally unbound star-formation mode. We also demonstrate that One-Class
Support Vector Machines can be effectively used to unveil the full stellar
populations of nearby stellar systems with Gaia data.",2020-02-13T19:00:00Z
"Interpreting LSTM Prediction on Solar Flare Eruption with Time-series
  Clustering","We conduct a post hoc analysis of solar flare predictions made by a Long
Short Term Memory (LSTM) model employing data in the form of Space-weather HMI
Active Region Patches (SHARP) parameters calculated from data in proximity to
the magnetic polarity inversion line where the flares originate. We train the
the LSTM model for binary classification to provide a prediction score for the
probability of M/X class flares to occur in next hour. We then develop a
dimension-reduction technique to reduce the dimensions of SHARP parameter (LSTM
inputs) and demonstrate the different patterns of SHARP parameters
corresponding to the transition from low to high prediction score. Our work
shows that a subset of SHARP parameters contain the key signals that strong
solar flare eruptions are imminent. The dynamics of these parameters have a
highly uniform trajectory for many events whose LSTM prediction scores for M/X
class flares transition from very low to very high. The results demonstrate the
existence of a few threshold values of SHARP parameters that when surpassed
indicate a high probability of the eruption of a strong flare. Our method has
distilled the knowledge of solar flare eruption learnt by deep learning model
and provides a more interpretable approximation, which provides physical
insight to processes driving solar flares.",2019-12-27T22:56:01Z
"APOGEE Net: Improving the derived spectral parameters for young stars
  through deep learning","Machine learning allows efficient extraction of physical properties from
stellar spectra that have been obtained by large surveys. The viability of ML
approaches has been demonstrated for spectra covering a variety of wavelengths
and spectral resolutions, but most often for main sequence or evolved stars,
where reliable synthetic spectra provide labels and data for training. Spectral
models of young stellar objects (YSOs) and low mass main sequence (MS) stars
are less well-matched to their empirical counterparts, however, posing barriers
to previous approaches to classify spectra of such stars. In this work we
generate labels for YSOs and low mass MS stars through their photometry. We
then use these labels to train a deep convolutional neural network to predict
log g, Teff, and Fe/H for stars with APOGEE spectra in the DR14 dataset. This
""APOGEE Net"" has produced reliable predictions of log g for YSOs, with
uncertainties of within 0.1 dex and a good agreement with the structure
indicated by pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks, and correlate well with
independently derived stellar radii. These values will be useful for studying
pre-main sequence stellar populations to accurately diagnose membership and
ages.",2020-02-19T19:05:03Z
How Many Elements Matter?,"Some studies of stars' multi-element abundance distributions suggest at least
5-7 significant dimensions, but others show that many elemental abundances can
be predicted to high accuracy from [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] (or [Fe/H] and age)
alone. We show that both propositions can be, and are, simultaneously true. We
adopt a machine learning technique known as normalizing flow to reconstruct the
probability distribution of Milky Way disk stars in the space of 15 elemental
abundances measured by APOGEE. Conditioning on Teff and log g minimizes the
differential systematics. After further conditioning on [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe], the
residual scatter for most abundances is $\sigma_{[X/{\rm H}]} \lesssim 0.02$
dex, consistent with APOGEE's reported statistical uncertainties of
$\sim$0.01-0.015 dex and intrinsic scatter of 0.01-0.02 dex. Despite the small
scatter, residual abundances display clear correlations between elements, which
we show are too large to be explained by measurement uncertainties or by the
finite sampling noise. We must condition on at least seven elements to reduce
correlations to a level consistent with observational uncertainties. Our
results demonstrate that cross-element correlations are a much more sensitive
probe of hidden structure than dispersion, and they can be measured precisely
in a large sample even if star-by-star measurement noise is comparable to the
intrinsic scatter. We conclude that many elements have an independent story to
tell, even for the ""mundane"" disk stars and elements produced by core-collapse
and Type Ia supernovae. The only way to learn these lessons is to measure the
abundances directly, and not merely infer them.",2021-02-09T18:01:12Z
SunnyNet: A neural network approach to 3D non-LTE radiative transfer,"Context. Computing spectra from 3D simulations of stellar atmospheres when
allowing for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) is
computationally very intensive. Aims. We develop a machine learning based
method to speed up 3D non-LTE radiative transfer calculations in optically
thick stellar atmospheres. Methods. Making use of a variety of 3D simulations
of the solar atmosphere, we trained a convolutional neural network, SunnyNet,
to learn the translation from LTE to non-LTE atomic populations. Non-LTE
populations computed with an existing 3D code were considered as the true
values. The network was then used to predict non-LTE populations for other 3D
simulations, and synthetic spectra were computed from its predicted non-LTE
populations. We used a six-level model atom of hydrogen and H$\alpha$ spectra
as test cases. Results. SunnyNet gives reasonable predictions for non-LTE
populations with a dramatic speedup of about 10$^5$ times when running on a
single GPU and compared to existing codes. When using different snapshots of
the same simulation for training and testing, SunnyNet's predictions are within
20-40% of the true values for most points, which results in average differences
of a few percent in H$\alpha$ spectra. Predicted H$\alpha$ intensity maps agree
very well with existing codes. Most importantly, they show the telltale signs
of 3D radiative transfer in the morphology of chromospheric fibrils. The
results are not as reliable when the training and testing are done with
different families of simulations. SunnyNet is open source and publicly
available.",2021-12-27T19:00:01Z

bright points (BPs). To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of the
longitudinal oscillations with damping in BPs using comprehensive consideration
of the Doppler velocity at various wavelengths. The phenomena of attenuation in
the red and blue Doppler shifts of the solar wavelength range were seen several
times during the experiments. We utilized deep learning techniques to examine
the statistical properties of damping in network and internetwork BPs, as well
as active, quiet areas, and coronal hole areas. Our results revealed varying
damping rates across different regions, with 80 percent of network BPs
exhibiting damping in quiet areas and 72 in coronal hole areas. In active
areas, the figure approached 33. For internetwork BPs, the values were 65, 54,
and 63 percent for quiet areas, coronal hole areas, and active regions,
respectively. The damping rate in active regions is twice as high at
Internetwork's BPs. The damping components in this study were computed, and the
findings show that the damping at all points is underdamped. The observed
damping process suggests the propagation and leaking of energetic waves out of
TR bright points, potentially contributing to the energy transport from the
bright magnetic footpoints to the upper chromosphere, transition region, and
corona.",2024-06-15T19:22:42Z
Epsilon Aurigae: An improved spectroscopic orbital solution,"A rare eclipse of the mysterious object Epsilon Aurigae will occur in
2009-2011. We report an updated single-lined spectroscopic solution for the
orbit of the primary star based on 20 years of monitoring at the CfA, combined
with historical velocity observations dating back to 1897. There are 518 new
CfA observations obtained between 1989 and 2009. Two solutions are presented.
One uses the velocities outside the eclipse phases together with mid-times of
previous eclipses, from photometry dating back to 1842, which provide the
strongest constraint on the ephemeris. This yields a period of 9896.0 +/- 1.6
days (27.0938 +/- 0.0044 years) with a velocity semi-amplitude of 13.84 +/-
0.23 km/s and an eccentricity of 0.227 +/- 0.011. The middle of the current
on-going eclipse predicted by this combined fit is JD 2,455,413.8 +/- 4.8,
corresponding to 2010 August 5. If we use only the radial velocities, we find
that the predicted middle of the current eclipse is nine months earlier. This
would imply that the gravitating companion is not the same as the eclipsing
object. Alternatively, the purely spectroscopic solution may be biased by
perturbations in the velocities due to the short-period oscillations of the
supergiant.",2010-01-27T20:10:04Z
Alpha Element Abundances in a Large Sample of Galactic Planetary Nebulae,"We present emission line strengths, abundances, and element ratios (X/O for
Ne, S, Cl, and Ar) for a sample of 38 Galactic disk planetary nebulae (PNe)
consisting primarily of Peimbert classification Type I. Spectrophotometry for
these PNe incorporates an extended optical/near-IR range of 3600-9600 angstroms
including the [S III] lines at 9069 and 9532. We have utilized Emission Line
Spectrum Analyzer, a five-level atom abundance routine, to determine T_e, N_e,
ionization correction factors, and total element abundances. With a compilation
of data from >120 Milky Way PNe, we present results from our most recent
analysis of abundance patterns in Galactic disk PNe. We have examined the alpha
elements against H II regions and blue compact galaxies (H2BCG) to discern
signatures of depletion or enhancement in PNe progenitor stars, particularly
the destruction or production of O and Ne. We present evidence that many PNe
have higher Ne/O and lower Ar/Ne ratios compared to H2BCGs within the range of
8.5-9.0 for 12 + log(O/H). This suggests that Ne is being synthesized in the
low- and intermediate-mass progenitors. Sulfur abundances in PNe continue to
show great scatter and are systematically lower than those found in H2BCG at a
given metallicity. Although we find that PNe do show some distinction in alpha
elements when compared to H2BCG, within the Peimbert classification types
studied, PNe do not show significant differences in alpha elements amongst
themselves, at least to an extent that would distinguish in situ
nucleosynthesis from the observed dispersion in abundance ratios.",2010-02-18T20:24:20Z
Near-infrared study of the stellar population of Sh2-152,"Context: The discovery of new massive star clusters and massive stellar
populations in previously known clusters in our Galaxy by means of infrared
studies has changed our view of the Milky Way from an inactive to an active
star-forming machine. Within this scenario, we present a near-infrared
spectrophotometric study of the stellar content of the compact H II region
Sh2-152.
  Aims: We aim to determine the distance, extinction, age, and mass of Sh2-152,
using for the first time near-infrared stellar classification for several
sources in the region.
  Methods: Using our near-infrared (J, H, and Ks) photometry and the
colour-magnitude diagram for the cluster field, we selected 13 bright stars,
candidate members of the reddened cluster's main sequence, for H- and K-
spectroscopy and spectral classification. This near-infrared information was
complemented with an optical spectrum of the ionizing central star to confirm
its spectral nature.
  Results: From the 13 spectroscopically observed stars, 5 were classified as
B-type, 3 as G-type, 2 were young stellar objects (YSOs), and 3 remained
unclassified (because of the poor data quality). The cluster's extinction
varies from A_{Ks}=0.5 to 2.6 magnitudes (A_V=4.5 to 24 magnitudes) and the
distance is estimated to be 3.21\pm0.21 kpc. The age of the cluster is younger
than 9.4 Myr and the lower limit to the total mass of the cluster is
(2.45\pm0.79)\cdot10^3 M_{Sun}. We compare the number of ionizing photons
emitted from the OB-type stars with the Lyman continuum photons derived from
the radio observations and conclude that both quantities are consistent for the
central region of Sh2-152. In contrast, the main ionizing source of the lower
region remains unidentified.",2011-08-31T15:14:38Z
"A Search for Stars of Very Low Metal Abundance. VI. Detailed Abundances
  of 313 Metal-Poor Stars","We present radial velocities, equivalent widths, model atmosphere parameters,
and abundances or upper limits for 53 species of 48 elements derived from high
resolution optical spectroscopy of 313 metal-poor stars. A majority of these
stars were selected from the metal-poor candidates of the HK Survey of Beers,
Preston, and Shectman. We derive detailed abundances for 61% of these stars for
the first time. Spectra were obtained during a 10-year observing campaign using
the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph on the Magellan Telescopes at
Las Campanas Observatory, the Robert G. Tull Coude Spectrograph on the Harlan
J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory, and the High Resolution
Spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope at McDonald Observatory. We perform
a standard LTE abundance analysis using MARCS model atmospheres, and we apply
line-by-line statistical corrections to minimize systematic abundance
differences arising when different sets of lines are available for analysis. We
identify several abundance correlations with effective temperature. A
comparison with previous abundance analyses reveals significant differences in
stellar parameters, which we investigate in detail. Our metallicities are, on
average, lower by approx. 0.25 dex for red giants and approx. 0.04 dex for
subgiants. Our sample contains 19 stars with [Fe/H] < -3.5, 84 stars with
[Fe/H] < -3.0, and 210 stars with [Fe/H] < -2.5. Detailed abundances are
presented here or elsewhere for 91% of the 209 stars with [Fe/H] < -2.5 as
estimated from medium resolution spectroscopy by Beers, Preston, and Shectman.
We will discuss the interpretation of these abundances in subsequent papers.",2014-03-26T20:37:58Z
"An empirical calibration to estimate cool dwarf fundamental parameters
  from H-band spectra","Interferometric radius measurements provide a direct probe of the fundamental
parameters of M dwarfs, but is within reach for only a limited sample of
nearby, bright stars. We use interferometrically-measured radii, bolometric
luminosities, and effective temperatures to develop new empirical calibrations
based on low-resolution, near-infrared spectra. We use H-band Mg and Al
features to derive calibrations for effective temperature, radius and log
luminosity; the standard deviations in the residuals of our best fits are,
respectively, 73K, 0.027Rsun, and 0.049 dex (11% error on luminosity). These
relationships are valid for mid K to mid M dwarf stars, roughly corresponding
to temperatures between 3100 and 4800K. We apply our calibrations to M dwarfs
targeted by the MEarth transiting planet survey and to the cool Kepler Objects
of Interest (KOIs). We independently validate our calibrations by demonstrating
a clear relationship between our inferred parameters and the absolute K
magnitudes of the MEarth stars, and we identify objects with magnitudes too
bright for their estimated luminosities as candidate multiple systems. We also
use our inferred luminosities to address the applicability of near-infrared
metallicity calibrations to mid and late M dwarfs. The temperatures we infer
for the KOIs agree remarkably well with those from the literature; however, our
stellar radii are systematically larger than those presented in previous works
that derive radii from model isochrones. This results in a mean planet radius
that is 15% larger than one would infer using the stellar properties from
recent catalogs. Our results confirm those of previous in-depth studies of
Kepler-42, Kepler-45, and Kepler-186.",2014-12-08T21:00:05Z
"How to Constrain Your M Dwarf: measuring effective temperature,
  bolometric luminosity, mass, and radius","Precise and accurate parameters for late-type (late K and M) dwarf stars are
important for characterization of any orbiting planets, but such determinations
have been hampered by these stars' complex spectra and dissimilarity to the
Sun. We exploit an empirically calibrated method to estimate spectroscopic
effective temperature ($T_{\rm{eff}}$) and the Stefan-Boltzmann law to
determine radii of 183 nearby K7-M7 single stars with a precision of 2-5%. Our
improved stellar parameters enable us to develop model-independent relations
between $T_{\rm{eff}}$ or absolute magnitude and radius, as well as between
color and $T_{\rm{eff}}$. The derived $T_{\rm{eff}}$-radius relation depends
strongly on [Fe/H], as predicted by theory. The relation between absolute $K_S$
magnitude and radius can predict radii accurate to $\simeq$3%. We derive
bolometric corrections to the $VR_CI_CgrizJHK_S$ and Gaia passbands as a
function of color, accurate to 1-3%. We confront the reliability of predictions
from Dartmouth stellar evolution models using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo to
find the values of unobservable model parameters (mass, age) that best
reproduce the observed effective temperature and bolometric flux while
satisfying constraints on distance and metallicity as Bayesian priors. With the
inferred masses we derive a semi-empirical mass-absolute magnitude relation
with a scatter of 2% in mass. The best-agreement models over-predict stellar
$T_{\rm{eff}}$s by an average of 2.2% and under-predict stellar radii by 4.6%,
similar to differences with values from low-mass eclipsing binaries. These
differences are not correlated with metallicity, mass, or indicators of
activity, suggesting issues with the underlying model assumptions e.g.,
opacities or convective mixing length.",2015-01-07T21:00:11Z
"An automated classification approach to ranking photospheric proxies of
  magnetic energy build-up","We study the photospheric magnetic field of ~2000 active regions in solar
cycle 23 to search for parameters indicative of energy build-up and subsequent
release as a solar flare. We extract three sets of parameters: snapshots in
space and time- total flux, magnetic gradients, and neutral lines; evolution in
time- flux evolution; structures at multiple size scales- wavelet analysis.
This combines pattern recognition and classification techniques via a relevance
vector machine to determine whether a region will flare. We consider
classification performance using all 38 extracted features and several feature
subsets. Classification performance is quantified using both the true positive
rate and the true negative rate. Additionally, we compute the true skill score
which provides an equal weighting to true positive rate and true negative rate
and the Heidke skill score to allow comparison to other flare forecasting work.
  We obtain a true skill score of ~0.5 for any predictive time window in the
range 2-24hr, with a TPR of ~0.8 and a TNR of ~0.7. These values do not appear
to depend on the time window, although the Heidke skill score (<0.5) does.
Features relating to snapshots of the distribution of magnetic gradients show
the best predictive ability over all predictive time windows. Other
gradient-related features and the instantaneous power at various wavelet scales
also feature in the top five ranked features in predictive power. While the
photospheric magnetic field governs the coronal non-potentiality (and
likelihood of flaring), photospheric magnetic field alone is not sufficient to
determine this uniquely. Furthermore we are only measuring proxies of the
magnetic energy build up. We still lack observational details on why energy is
released at any particular point in time. We may have discovered the natural
limit of the accuracy of flare predictions from these large scale studies.",2015-06-29T16:21:25Z
"Linking Stellar Coronal Activity and Rotation at 500 Myr: A Deep Chandra
  Observation of M37","Empirical calibrations of the stellar age-rotation-activity relation (ARAR)
rely on observations of the co-eval populations of stars in open clusters. We
used the Chandra X-ray Observatory to study M37, a 500-Myr-old open cluster
that has been extensively surveyed for rotation periods ($P_{\rm rot}$). M37
was observed almost continuously for five days, for a total of 440.5 ksec, to
measure stellar X-ray luminosities ($L_{\mathrm{X}}$), a proxy for coronal
activity, across a wide range of masses. The cluster's membership catalog was
revisited to calculate updated membership probabilities from photometric data
and each star's distance to the cluster center. The result is a comprehensive
sample of 1699 M37 members: 426 with $P_{\rm rot}$, 278 with X-ray detections,
and 76 with both. We calculate Rossby numbers, $R_o = P_{\rm rot}/\tau$, where
$\tau$ is the convective turnover time, and ratios of the X-ray-to-bolometric
luminosity, $L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol}$, to minimize mass dependencies in our
characterization of the rotation-coronal activity relation at 500 Myr. We find
that fast rotators, for which $R_o<0.09\pm0.01$, show saturated levels of
activity, with log($L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol}$)$=-3.06\pm0.04$. For
$R_o\geq0.09\pm0.01$, activity is unsaturated and follows a power law of the
form $R_o^\beta$, where $\beta$=$-2.03_{-0.14}^{+0.17}$. This is the largest
sample available for analyzing the dependence of coronal emission on rotation
for a single-aged population, covering stellar masses in the range 0.4$-$1.3
$M_{\odot}$, $P_{\rm rot}$ in the range 0.4$-$12.8 d, and $L_{\rm X}$ in the
range 10$^{28.4-30.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Our results make M37 a new benchmark open
cluster for calibrating the ARAR at ages of $\approx$500 Myr.",2015-07-08T23:04:14Z
"IAU commission 10 ""Solar Activity"": Legacy report and triennial report
  for 2012-2015","After more than half a century of community support related to the science of
""solar activity'', IAU's Commission 10 was formally discontinued in 2015, to be
succeeded by C.E2 with the same area of responsibility. On this occasion, we
look back at the growth of the scientific disciplines involved around the world
over almost a full century. Solar activity and fields of research looking into
the related physics of the heliosphere continue to be vibrant and growing, with
currently over 2,000 refereed publications appearing per year from over 4,000
unique authors, publishing in dozens of distinct journals and meeting in dozens
of workshops and conferences each year. The size of the rapidly growing
community and of the observational and computational data volumes, along with
the multitude of connections into other branches of astrophysics, pose
significant challenges; aspects of these challenges are beginning to be
addressed through, among others, the development of new systems of literature
reviews, machine-searchable archives for data and publications, and virtual
observatories. As customary in these reports, we highlight some of the research
topics that have seen particular interest over the most recent triennium,
specifically active-region magnetic fields, coronal thermal structure, coronal
seismology, flares and eruptions, and the variability of solar activity on long
time scales. We close with a collection of developments, discoveries, and
surprises that illustrate the range and dynamics of the discipline.",2015-10-12T16:02:24Z
"Calibration of the MEarth Photometric System: Optical Magnitudes and
  Photometric Metallicity Estimates for 1802 Nearby M-dwarfs","The MEarth Project is a photometric survey systematically searching the
smallest stars nearest to the Sun for transiting rocky planets. Since 2008,
MEarth has taken approximately two million images of 1844 stars suspected to be
mid-to-late M dwarfs. We have augmented this survey by taking nightly exposures
of photometric standard stars and have utilized this data to photometrically
calibrate the $MEarth$ system, identify photometric nights, and obtain an
optical magnitude with $1.5\%$ precision for each M dwarf system. Each optical
magnitude is an average over many years of data, and therefore should be
largely immune to stellar variability and flaring. We combine this with
trigonometric distance measurements, spectroscopic metallicity measurements,
and 2MASS infrared magnitude measurements in order to derive a
color-magnitude-metallicity relation across the mid-to-late M dwarf spectral
sequence that can reproduce spectroscopic metallicity determinations to a
precision of 0.1 dex. We release optical magnitudes and metallicity estimates
for 1567 M dwarfs, many of which did not have an accurate determination of
either prior to this work. For an additional 277 stars without a trigonometric
parallax, we provide an estimate of the distance assuming solar neighborhood
metallicity. We find that the median metallicity for a volume limited sample of
stars within 20 parsecs of the Sun is [Fe/H] = $-0.03 \pm 0.008$, and that 29 /
565 of these stars have a metallicity of [Fe/H] = $-0.5$ or lower, similar to
the low-metallicity distribution of nearby G-dwarfs. When combined with the
results of ongoing and future planet surveys targeting these objects, the
metallicity estimates presented here will be important in assessing the
significance of any putative planet-metallicity correlation.",2015-10-22T18:27:15Z
"The X-ray luminosity function of M37 and the evolution of coronal
  activity in low-mass stars","We use a 440.5 ks Chandra observation of the $\approx$500-Myr-old open
cluster M37 to derive the X-ray luminosity functions of its $\leq1.2$
$M_{\odot}$ stars. Combining detections of 162 M37 members with upper limits
for 160 non-detections, we find that its G, K, and M stars have a similar
median (0.5$-$7 keV) X-ray luminosity L$_X =10^{29.0}$ erg/s, whereas the
L$_X$-to-bolometric-luminosity ratio (L$_X$/L$_{bol}$) indicates that M stars
are more active than G and K stars by $\approx$1 order of magnitude at 500 Myr.
To characterize the evolution of magnetic activity in low-mass stars over their
first $\approx$600 Myr, we consolidate X-ray and optical data from the
literature for stars in six other open clusters: from youngest to oldest, the
Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), NGC 2547, NGC 2516, the Pleiades, NGC 6475, and the
Hyades. For these, we homogenize the conversion of instrumental count rates to
L$_X$ by applying the same one-temperature emission model as for M37, and
obtain masses using the same empirical mass-absolute magnitude relation (except
for the ONC). We find that for G and K stars X-ray activity decreases
$\approx$2 orders of magnitude over their first 600 Myr, and for M stars,
$\approx$1.5. The decay rate of the median L$_X$ follows the relation L$_X
\propto~t^b$, where $b=-0.61\pm0.12$ for G, $-0.82\pm0.16$ for K, and
$-0.40\pm0.17$ for M stars. In L$_X$/L$_{bol}$ space, the slopes are
$-0.68\pm0.12$, $-0.81\pm0.19$, and $-0.61\pm0.12$, respectively. These results
suggest that for low-mass stars the age-activity relation steepens after
$\approx$625 Myr, consistent with the faster decay in activity observed in
solar analogs at $t>1$ Gyr.",2016-07-20T00:46:37Z
"YSO jets in the Galactic Plane from UWISH2: IV - Jets and outflows in
  Cygnus-X","We have performed an unbiased search for outflows from young stars in
Cygnus-X using 42 deg$^2$ of data from the UKIRT Widefield Infrared Survey for
H$_2$ (UWISH2 survey), to identify shock-excited near-IR H$_2$ emission in the
1$-$0 S(1) 2.122 $\mu$m line. We uncovered 572 outflows, of which 465 are new
discoveries, increasing the number of known objects by more than 430%. This
large and unbiased sample allows us to statistically determine the typical
properties of outflows from young stars.
  We found 261 bipolar outflows and 16% of these are parsec-scale. The typical
bipolar outflow is 0.45pc in length and has gaps of 0.025 to 0.1pc between
large knots. The median luminosity in the 1$-$0 S(1) line is 10$^{-3}$
L$_{\odot}$. The bipolar flows are typically asymmetrical, with the two lobes
misaligned by 5$^{\circ}$, one lobe 30% shorter than the other, and one lobe
twice as bright as the other. Of the remaining outflows, 152 are single-sided
and 159 are groups of extended, shock-excited H$_2$ emission without
identifiable driving sources. Half of all driving sources have sufficient WISE
data to determine their evolutionary status as either protostars (80%) or
classical T-Tauri stars (20%). One fifth of the driving sources are variable by
more than 0.5mag in the K-band continuum over several years.
  Several of the newly-identified outflows provide excellent targets for follow
up studies. We particularly encourage the study of the outflows and young stars
identified in a bright-rimmed cloud near IRAS 20294$+$4255, which seems to
represent a textbook example of triggered star formation.",2017-08-01T15:48:04Z
"A multi-wavelength search for intrinsic linear polarization in
  Wolf-Rayet winds","Wolf-Rayet stars have strong, hot winds, with mass-loss rates at least a
factor of ten greater than their O-star progenitors, although their terminal
wind speeds are similar. In this paper we use the technique of multiband linear
polarimetry to extract information on the global asymmetry of the wind in a
sample of 47 bright Galactic WR stars. Our observations also include
time-dependent observations of 17 stars in the sample. The path to our goal
includes removing the dominating component of wavelength-dependent interstellar
polarization (ISP), which normally follows the well-known Serkowski law. We
include a wavelength-dependent ISP position angle parameter in our ISP law and
find that 15 stars show significant results for this parameter. We detect a
significant component of wavelength-independent polarization due to electron
scattering in the wind for 10 cases, with most WR stars showing none at the
$\sim$0.05% level precision of our data. The intrinsically polarized stars can
be explained with binary interaction, large-scale wind structure, and clumping.
We also found that 5 stars out of 19 observed with the Str\""omgren $b$ filter
(probing the complex $\lambda$4600--4700 emission line region) have significant
residuals from the ISP law and propose that this is due to binary illumination
or wind clumping. We provide a useful catalogue of ISP for 47 bright Galactic
WR stars and upper limits on the possible level of intrinsic polarization.",2019-12-27T17:19:39Z
CCD Parallaxes for 309 Late-type Dwarfs and Subdwarfs,"New, updated, and/or revised CCD parallaxes determined with the Strand
Astrometric Reflector at the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS) are
presented. Included are results for 309 late-type dwarf and subdwarf stars
observed over the 30+ years that the program operated. For 124 of the stars,
parallax determinations from other investigators have already appeared in the
literature and we compare the different results. Also included here is new or
updated $VI$ photometry on the Johnson-Kron-Cousins system for all but a few of
the faintest targets. Together with 2MASS $JHK_s$ near-infrared photometry, a
sample of absolute magnitude versus color and color versus color diagrams are
constructed. Since large proper motion was a prime criterion for targeting the
stars, the majority turn out to be either M-type subdwarfs or late M-type
dwarfs. The sample also includes 50 dwarf or subdwarf L-type stars, and four T
dwarfs. Possible halo subdwarfs are identified in the sample based on
tangential velocity, subluminosity, and spectral type. Residuals from the
solutions for parallax and proper motion for several stars show evidence of
astrometric perturbations.",2017-09-08T14:57:36Z
"Rotation Periods of 34,030 Kepler Main-Sequence Stars: The Full
  Autocorrelation Sample","We analyzed 3 years of data from the Kepler space mission to derive rotation
periods of main-sequence stars below 6500 K. Our automated
autocorrelation-based method detected rotation periods between 0.2 and 70 days
for 34,030 (25.6%) of the 133,030 main-sequence Kepler targets (excluding known
eclipsing binaries and Kepler Objects of Interest), making this the largest
sample of stellar rotation periods to date. In this paper we consider the
detailed features of the now well-populated period-temperature distribution and
demonstrate that the period bimodality, first seen by McQuillan, Aigrain &
Mazeh (2013) in the M-dwarf sample, persists to higher masses, becoming less
visible above 0.6 M_sun. We show that these results are globally consistent
with the existing ground-based rotation-period data and find that the upper
envelope of the period distribution is broadly consistent with a
gyrochronological age of 4.5 Gyrs, based on the isochrones of Barnes (2007),
Mamajek & Hillenbrand (2008) and Meibom et al. (2009). We also performed a
detailed comparison of our results to those of Reinhold et al. (2013) and
Nielsen et al. (2013), who have measured rotation periods of field stars
observed by Kepler. We examined the amplitude of periodic variability for the
stars with detected rotation periods, and found a typical range between ~950
ppm (5th percentile) and ~22,700 ppm (95th percentile), with a median of ~5,600
ppm. We found typically higher amplitudes for shorter periods and lower
effective temperatures, with an excess of low-amplitude stars above ~5400 K.",2014-02-24T00:23:52Z
High-resolution Ultraviolet Radiation Fields of Classical T Tauri Stars,"The far-ultraviolet (FUV; 912--1700 \AA) radiation field from accreting
central stars in Classical T Tauri systems influences the disk chemistry during
the period of giant planet formation. Previous efforts to measure the true
stellar+accretion-generated FUV luminosity (both hot gas emission lines and
continua) have been complicated by a combination of low-sensitivity and/or
low-spectral resolution and did not include the contribution from the bright
Ly$\alpha$ emission line. In this work, we present a high-resolution
spectroscopic study of the FUV radiation fields of 16 T Tauri stars whose dust
disks display a range of evolutionary states. We include reconstructed
Ly$\alpha$ line profiles and remove atomic and molecular disk emission (from
H$_{2}$ and CO fluorescence) to provide robust measurements of both the FUV
continuum and hot gas lines (e.g., Ly$\alpha$, \ion{N}{5}, \ion{C}{4},
\ion{He}{2}) for an appreciable sample of T Tauri stars for the first time. We
find that the flux of the typical Classical T Tauri Star FUV radiation field at
1 AU from the central star is $\sim$ 10$^{7}$ times the average interstellar
radiation field. The Ly$\alpha$ emission line contributes an average of 88% of
the total FUV flux, with the FUV continuum accounting for an average of 8%.
Both the FUV continuum and Ly$\alpha$ flux are strongly correlated with
\ion{C}{4} flux, suggesting that accretion processes dominate the production of
both of these components. On average, only $\sim$ 0.5% of the total FUV flux is
emitted between the Lyman limit (912 \AA) and the H$_{2}$ (0 -- 0) absorption
band at 1110 \AA. The total and component-level high-resolution radiation
fields are made publicly available in machine-readable format.",2014-02-25T21:00:33Z
"Interstellar Detection of Methyl Isocyanate CH$_3$NCO in Sgr B2(N): A
  Link from Molecular Clouds to Comets","A new interstellar molecule, CH$_3$NCO (methyl isocyanate), has been detected
using the 12 m telescope of the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO). CH$_3$NCO was
identified in spectra covering 48 GHz (68-116 GHz) in the 3 mm segment of a
broadband survey of Sgr B2(N). Thirty very favorable rotational lines (K$_a$ =
0 and K$_a$ = 1 only; E$_u$ < 60 K) originating in five consecutive transitions
(J = 8 $\rightarrow$ 7, 9 $\rightarrow$ 8, 10 $\rightarrow$ 9, 11 $\rightarrow$
10, and 12 $\rightarrow$ 11) in both the A and E internal rotation species are
present in this frequency range. Emission was observed at all of the predicted
frequencies, with seventeen lines appearing as distinct, uncontaminated
spectral features, clearly showing the classic a-type, asymmetric top pattern,
with T$_R$* ~ 20-70 mK. The CH$_3$NCO spectra also appear to exhibit two
velocities components near V$_{LSR}$ ~ 62 and 73 km s$^{-1}$, both with
$\Delta$V$_{1/2}$ ~ 10 km s$^{-1}$ - typical of molecules such as CH$_2$CHCN,
HNCO, and HCOOCH$_3$ in Sgr B2(N). The column density of CH$_3$NCO in Sgr B2(N)
was determined to be N$_{tot}$ ~ 2.3 x 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ and 1.5 x 10$^{13}$
cm$^{-2}$ for the 62 and 73 km s$^{-1}$ components, corresponding to fractional
abundances, relative to H$_2$, of f ~ 7.6 x 10$^{-12}$ and 5.0 x 10$^{-12}$,
respectively. CH$_3$NCO was recently detected in volatized material from comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by Rosetta's Philae lander, with an abundance ~1.3%
of water; in Sgr B2(N), CH$_3$NCO is roughly ~0.04% of the H$_2$O abundance.",2015-09-30T19:25:33Z
"Automated detection of small-scale magnetic flux ropes in the solar
  wind: First results from the Wind spacecraft measurements","We have developed a new automated small-scale magnetic flux rope (SSMFR)
detection algorithm based on the Grad-Shafranov (GS) reconstruction technique.
We have applied this detection algorithm to the Wind spacecraft in-situ
measurements during 1996 - 2016, covering two solar cycles, and successfully
detected a total number of 74,241 small-scale magnetic flux rope events with
duration from 9 to 361 minutes. This large number of small-scale magnetic flux
ropes has not been discovered by any other previous studies through this unique
approach. We perform statistical analysis of the small-scale magnetic flux rope
events based on our newly developed database, and summarize the main findings
as follows. (1) The occurrence of small-scale flux ropes has strong solar cycle
dependency with a rate of a few hundreds per month on average. (2) The
small-scale magnetic flux ropes in the ecliptic plane tend to align along the
Parker spiral. (3) In low speed ($<$ 400 km/s) solar wind, the flux ropes tend
to have lower proton temperature and higher proton number density, while in
high speed ($\ge$ 400 km/s) solar wind, they tend to have higher proton
temperature and lower proton number density. (4) Both the duration and scale
size distributions of the small-scale magnetic flux ropes obey a power law. (5)
The waiting time distribution of small-scale magnetic flux ropes can be fitted
by an exponential function (for shorter waiting times) and a power law function
(for longer waiting times). (6) The wall-to-wall time distribution obeys double
power laws with the break point at 60 minutes (corresponding to the correlation
length). (7) The small-scale magnetic flux ropes tend to accumulate near the
heliospheric current sheet (HCS). The entire database is available at
\url{http://fluxrope.info} and in machine readable format in this article.",2018-10-02T14:50:29Z
"Birth of the ELMs: a ZTF survey for evolved cataclysmic variables
  turning into extremely low-mass white dwarfs","We present a systematic survey for mass-transferring and recently-detached
cataclysmic variables (CVs) with evolved secondaries, which are progenitors of
extremely low-mass white dwarfs (ELM WDs), AM CVn systems, and detached
ultracompact binaries. We select targets below the main sequence in the Gaia
color-magnitude diagram with ZTF light curves showing large-amplitude
ellipsoidal variability and orbital period $P_{\rm orb} < 6$ hr. This yields 51
candidates brighter than G=18, of which we have obtained many-epoch spectra for
21. We confirm all 21 to be completely -- or nearly -- Roche lobe filling close
binaries. 13 show evidence of ongoing mass transfer, which has likely just
ceased in the other 8. Most of the secondaries are hotter than any previously
known CV donors, with temperatures $4700<T_{{\rm eff}}/{\rm K}<8000$.
Remarkably, all secondaries with $T_{\rm eff} \gtrsim 7000\,\rm K$ appear to be
detached, while all cooler secondaries are still mass-transferring. This
transition likely marks the temperature where magnetic braking becomes
inefficient due to loss of the donor's convective envelope. Most of the
proto-WD secondaries have masses near $0.15\,M_{\odot}$; their companions have
masses near $0.8\,M_{\odot}$. We infer a space density of $\sim 60\,\rm
kpc^{-3}$, roughly 80 times lower than that of normal CVs and three times lower
than that of ELM WDs. The implied Galactic birth rate, $\mathcal{R}\sim 60\,\rm
Myr^{-1}$, is half that of AM CVn binaries. Most systems are well-described by
MESA models for CVs in which mass transfer begins only as the donor leaves the
main sequence. All are predicted to reach minimum periods $5\lesssim P_{\rm
orb}/{\rm min}\lesssim30$ within a Hubble time, where they will become AM CVn
binaries or merge. This sample triples the known evolved CV population and
offers broad opportunities for improving understanding of the compact binary
population.",2021-08-09T18:00:03Z
A Census of Above-Horizontal-Branch Stars in Galactic Globular Clusters,"We have carried out a search for above-horizontal-branch (AHB) stars--objects
lying above the horizontal branch (HB) and blueward of the asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) in the color-magnitude diagram--in 97 Galactic and seven
Magellanic Cloud globular clusters (GCs). We selected AHB candidates based on
photometry in the $uBVI$ system, which is optimized for detection of
low-gravity stars with large Balmer jumps, in the color range
$-0.05\le(B-V)_0\le1.0$. We then used $Gaia$ astrometry and Gaussian-mixture
modeling to confirm cluster membership and remove field interlopers. Our final
catalog contains 438 AHB stars, classified and interpreted in the context of
post-HB evolution as follows: (1) AHB1: 280 stars fainter than $M_V=-0.8$,
evolving redward from the blue HB (BHB) toward the base of the AGB. (2)
Post-AGB (PAGB): 13 stars brighter than $M_V\simeq-2.75$, departing from the
top of the AGB and evolving rapidly blueward. (3) AHB2: 145 stars, with
absolute magnitudes between those of the AHB1 and PAGB groups. This last
category includes a mixture of objects leaving the extreme BHB and evolving
toward the AGB, and brighter ones moving back from the AGB toward higher
temperatures. Among the AHB1 stars are 59 RR Lyrae interlopers, observed by
chance in our survey near maximum light. PAGB and AHB2 stars (including W
Virginis Cepheids) overwhelmingly belong to GCs containing BHB stars, in
accordance with predictions of post-HB evolutionary tracks. We suggest that
most W Vir variables are evolving toward lower temperatures and are in their
first crossings of the instability strip. Non-variable yellow PAGB stars show
promise as a Population II standard candle for distance measurement.",2021-12-09T21:04:07Z
"Automatic detection of small-scale EUV brightenings observed by the
  Solar Orbiter/EUI","Context. Accurate detections of frequent small-scale extreme ultraviolet
(EUV) brightenings are essential to the investigation of the physical processes
heating the corona. Aims. We detected small-scale brightenings, termed
campfires, using their morphological and intensity structures as observed in
coronal EUV imaging observations for statistical analysis. Methods. We applied
a method based on Zernike moments and a support vector machine classifier to
automatically identify and track campfires observed by Solar Orbiter/Extreme
Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) and SDO/AIA. Results. This method detected 8678
campfires (with length scales between 400 km and 4000 km) from a sequence of 50
High Resolution EUV telescope (HRIEUV) 174{\AA} images. From 21 near
co-temporal AIA images covering the same field of view as EUI, we found 1131
campfires, 58% of which were also detected in HRIEUV images. In contrast, about
16% of campfires recognized in HRIEUV were detected by AIA. We obtain a
campfire birthrate of 2*10-16m-2s-1. About 40% of campfires show a duration
longer than 5 s, having been observed in at least two HRIEUV images. We find
that 27% of campfires were found in coronal bright points and the remaining 73%
have occurred out of coronal bright points. We detected 23 EUI campfires with a
duration greater than 245 s. We found that about 80% of campfires are formed at
supergranular boundaries, and the features with the highest total intensities
are generated at network junctions and intense H I Lyman-{\alpha} emission
regions observed by EUI/HRILya. The probability distribution functions for the
total intensity, peak intensity, and projected area of campfires follow a power
law behavior with absolute indices between 2 and 3. This self-similar behavior
is a possible signature of self-organization, or even self-organized
criticality, in the campfire formation process.",2022-04-08T12:27:03Z
"Cataclysmic Variables from Sloan Digital Sky Survey V -- the search for
  period bouncers continues","SDSS-V is carrying out a dedicated survey for white dwarfs, single and in
binaries, and we report the analysis of the spectroscopy of cataclysmic
variables (CVs) and CV candidates obtained during the final plug plate
observations of SDSS. We identify eight new CVs, spectroscopically confirm 53
and refute eleven published CV candidates, and we report 21 new or improved
orbital periods. Combined with previously published data, the orbital period
distribution of the SDSS-V CVs does not clearly exhibit a period gap. This is
consistent with previous findings that spectroscopically identified CVs have a
larger proportion of short-period systems compared to samples identified from
photometric variability. Remarkably, despite a systematic search, we find very
few period bouncers. We estimate the space density of period bouncers to be
$\simeq0.2\times10^{-6}\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$, i.e. they represent only a few per
cent of the total CV population. This suggests that during their final phase of
evolution, CVs either destroy the donor, e.g. via a merger, or that they become
detached and cease mass transfer.",2023-05-22T18:00:05Z
"Using the Maximum X-ray Flux Ratio and X-ray Background to Predict Solar
  Flare Class","We present the discovery of a relationship between the maximum ratio of the
flare flux (namely, 0.5-4 Ang to the 1-8 Ang flux) and non-flare background
(namely, the 1-8 Ang background flux), which clearly separates flares into
classes by peak flux level. We established this relationship based on an
analysis of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) X-ray
observations of ~ 50,000 X, M, C, and B flares derived from the NOAA/SWPC
flares catalog. Employing a combination of machine learning techniques
(K-nearest neighbors and nearest-centroid algorithms) we show a separation of
the observed parameters for the different peak flaring energies. This analysis
is validated by successfully predicting the flare classes for 100% of the
X-class flares, 76% of the M-class flares, 80% of the C-class flares and 81% of
the B-class flares for solar cycle 24, based on the training of the parametric
extracts for solar flares in cycles 22-23.",2015-04-01T17:03:15Z
Do open clusters have distinguishable chemical signatures?,"Past studies have already shown that stars in open clusters are chemically
homogeneous (e.g. De Silva et al. 2006, 2007 and 2009). These results support
the idea that stars born from the same giant molecular cloud should have the
same chemical composition. In this context, the chemical tagging technique was
proposed by Freeman & Bland-Hawthorn 2002. The principle is to recover
disrupted stellar clusters by looking only to the stellar chemical composition.
In order to evaluate the feasibility of this approach, it is necessary to test
if we can distinguish between stars born from different molecular clouds. For
this purpose, we studied the chemical composition of stars in 32 old and
intermediate-age open clusters, and we applied machine learning algorithms to
recover the original cluster by only considering the chemical signatures.",2015-07-22T19:38:08Z
Characterizing Variable Stars in a Single Night with LSST,"Stars exhibit a bewildering variety of variable behaviors ranging from
explosive magnetic flares to stochastically changing accretion to periodic
pulsations or rotations. The principal LSST surveys will have cadences too
sparse and irregular to capture most of these phenomena. A novel idea is
proposed here to observe a single Galactic field, rich in unobscured stars, in
a continuous sequence of $\sim 15$ second exposures for one long winter night
in a single photometric band. The result will be a unique dataset of $\sim 1$
million regularly spaced stellar lightcurves. The lightcurves will gives a
particularly comprehensive collection of dM star variability. A powerful array
of statistical procedures can be applied to the ensemble of lightcurves from
the long-standing fields of time series analysis, signal processing and
econometrics. Dozens of `features' describing the variability can be extracted
and subject to machine learning classification, giving a unique authoritative
objective classification of rapidly variable stars. The most effective features
can then inform the wider LSST community on the best approaches to variable
star identification and classification from the sparse, irregular cadences that
dominate the LSST project.",2019-01-23T17:12:26Z
"Correction to the photometric magnitudes of the Gaia Early Data Release
  3","In this letter, we have carried out an independent validation of the Gaia
EDR3 photometry using about 10,000 Landolt standard stars from Clem & Landolt
(2013). Using a machine learning technique, the UBVRI magnitudes are converted
into the Gaia magnitudes and colors and then compared to those in the EDR3,
with the effect of metallicity incorporated. Our result confirms the
significant improvements in the calibration process of the Gaia EDR3. Yet
modest trends up to 10 mmag with G magnitude are found for all the magnitudes
and colors for the 10 < G < 19 mag range, particularly for the bright and faint
ends. With the aid of synthetic magnitudes computed on the CALSPEC spectra with
the Gaia EDR3 passbands, absolute corrections are further obtained, paving the
way for optimal usage of the Gaia EDR3 photometry in high accuracy
investigations.",2021-01-04T03:25:42Z
"Time-series analyses of Cepheid and RR Lyrae variables in the wide-field
  variability surveys","We discuss time-series analyses of classical Cepheid and RR Lyrae variables
in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds at multiple wavelengths. We adopt the
Fourier decomposition method to quantify the structural changes in the light
curves of Cepheid and RR Lyrae variables. A quantitative comparison of Cepheid
Fourier parameters suggests that the canonical mass-luminosity models that lie
towards the red-edge of the instability strip show a greater offset with
respect to observations for short-period Cepheids. RR Lyrae models are
consistent with observations in most period bins. We use ensemble light curve
analysis to predict the physical parameters of observed Cepheid and RR Lyrae
variables using machine learning methods. Our preliminary results suggest that
the posterior distributions of mass, luminosity, temperature and radius for
Cepheids and RR Lyraes can be well-constrained for a given metal abundance,
provided a smoother grid of models is adopted in various input physical
parameters.",2018-10-17T02:54:57Z
"Image-based Classification of Variable Stars: First Results from Optical
  Gravitational Lensing Experiment Data","Recently, machine learning methods presented a viable solution for automated
classification of image-based data in various research fields and business
applications. Scientists require a fast and reliable solution to be able to
handle the always growing enormous amount of data in astronomy. However, so far
astronomers have been mainly classifying variable star light curves based on
various pre-computed statistics and light curve parameters. In this work we use
an image-based Convolutional Neural Network to classify the different types of
variable stars. We used images of phase-folded light curves from the OGLE-III
survey for training, validating and testing and used OGLE-IV survey as an
independent data set for testing. After the training phase, our neural network
was able to classify the different types between 80 and 99%, and 77-98%
accuracy for OGLE-III and OGLE-IV, respectively.",2020-06-13T10:51:42Z
A catalogue of 74 new open clusters found in Gaia Data-Release 2,"Based on astrometric data from Gaia DR2, we employ an unsupervised machine
learning method to blindly search for open star clusters in the Milky Way
within the Galactic latitude range of |b| < 20 degrees. In addition to 2,080
known clusters, 74 new open cluster candidates are found. In this work, we
present the positions, apparent radii, parallaxes, proper motions and member
stars of these candidates
(https://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/ftp/vizier.submit//new_OC/). Meanwhile, to obtain
the physical parameters of each candidate cluster, stellar isochrones are fit
to the photometric data. The results show that the apparent radii and the
observed proper motion dispersions of these new candidates are consistent with
those of open clusters previously identified in Gaia DR2.",2020-10-28T10:33:47Z
Membership of Stars in Open Clusters using Random Forest with Gaia Data,"Membership of stars in open clusters is one of the most crucial parameters in
studies of star clusters. Gaia opened a new window in the estimation of
membership because of its unprecedented 6-D data. In the present study, we used
published membership data of nine open star clusters as a training set to find
new members from Gaia DR2 data using a supervised random forest model with a
precision of around 90\%. The number of new members found is often double the
published number. Membership probability of a larger sample of stars in
clusters is a major benefit in determination of cluster parameters like
distance, extinction and mass functions. We also found members in the outer
regions of the cluster and found sub-structures in the clusters studied. The
color magnitude diagrams are more populated and enriched by the addition of new
members making their study more promising.",2021-03-10T02:19:24Z
"Forecasting GICs and geoelectric fields from solar wind data using
  LSTMs: application in Austria","The forecasting of local GIC effects has largely relied on the forecasting of
dB/dt as a proxy and, to date, little attention has been paid to directly
forecasting the geoelectric field or GICs themselves. We approach this problem
with machine learning tools, specifically recurrent neural networks or LSTMs by
taking solar wind observations as input and training the models to predict two
different kinds of output: first, the geoelectric field components Ex and Ey;
and second, the GICs in specific substations in Austria. The training is
carried out on the geoelectric field and GICs modelled from 26 years of
one-minute geomagnetic field measurements, and results are compared to GIC
measurements from recent years. The GICs are generally predicted better by an
LSTM trained on values from a specific substation, but only a fraction of the
largest GICs are correctly predicted. This model had a correlation with
measurements of around 0.6, and a root-mean-square error of 0.7 A. The
probability of detecting mild activity in GICs is around 50%, and 15% for
larger GICs.",2021-09-14T12:28:29Z
Integrated Geostationary Solar Energetic Particle Events Catalog: GSEP,"We present a catalog of solar energetic particle (SEP) events covering solar
cycles 22, 23 and 24. We correlate and integrate three existing catalogs based
on Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) integral proton
flux data. We visually verified and labeled each event in the catalog to
provide a homogenized data set. We have identified a total of 341 SEP events of
which 245 cross the space weather prediction center (SWPC) threshold of a
significant proton event. The metadata consists of physical parameters and
observables concerning the possible source solar eruptions, namely flares and
coronal mass ejections for each event. The sliced time series data of each
event, along with intensity profiles of proton fluxes in several energy bands,
have been made publicly available. This data set enables researchers in machine
learning (ML) and statistical analysis to understand the SEPs and the source
eruption characteristics useful for space weather prediction.",2022-04-26T01:30:04Z
"Reconstruction of the Solar Activity from the Catalogs of the Zurich
  Observatory","Catalogs of the Zurich Observatory contain positional information on
sunspots, prominences and faculae in late 19th and early 20th centuries. This
database is given in handwritten tabular form and was not systematically
analysed earlier. It is different from the sunspot number time series made in
Zurich and was obtained with a larger telescope. We trained a neural-network
model for handwritten text recognition and present the database of
reconstructed coordinates. The database obtained connects the earlier
observations by Sp\""orer with later programs of the 20th century and
supplements the sunspot-group catalogs of the Royal Greenwich Observatory. We
also expect that the presented machine-learning approach and its deep
capabilities will motivate the processing of a wide bulk of astronomical data,
which is still given in non-digitized form or as plain scanned images.",2022-05-20T13:19:10Z
Chemical Abundances for 25 JWST Exoplanet Host Stars with KeckSpec,"Using a data-driven machine learning tool we report $T_{\text{eff}}$,
$\log{(g)}$, $v\sin{(i)}$, and elemental abundances for 15 elements (C, N, O,
Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Y) for a sample of 25 exoplanet host
stars targeted by JWST's first year of observations. The chemical diversity of
these stars show that, while a number of their companion planets may have
formed in a disk with chemistry similar to Solar, some JWST targets likely
experienced different disk compositions. This sample is part of a larger
forthcoming catalog that will report homogeneous abundances of $\sim$4,500 FGK
stars derived from Keck/HIRES spectra.",2022-07-27T17:29:20Z
A Distance Measurement to M33 Using Optical Photometry of Mira Variables,"We present a systematic analysis to determine and improve the pulsation
periods of 1637 known long-period Mira variables in M33 using $gri$-band light
curves spanning $\sim18$~years from several surveys, including M33 variability
survey, Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, Palomar Transient
Factory (PTF), intermediate PTF, and Zwicky Transient Facility. Based on these
collections of light curves, we found that optical band light curves that are
as complete as possible are crucial to determine the periods of distant Miras.
We demonstrated that the machine learning techniques can be used to classify
Miras into O-rich and C-rich based on the $(J-K_s)$ period--color plane.
Finally, We derived the distance modulus to M33 using O-rich Miras at maximum
light together with our improved periods as $24.67 \pm 0.06$~mag, which is in
good agreement with the recommended value given in the literature.",2023-02-06T16:09:38Z
The enhanced YSO population in Serpens,"The Serpens Molecular Cloud is one of the most active sites of ongoing star
formation at a distance of about 300 pc, and hence is very well-suited for
studies of young low-mass stars and sub-stellar objects. In this paper, for the
Serpens star forming region, we find potential members of the Young Stellar
Objects population from the Gaia DR3 data and study their kinematics and
distribution. We compile a catalog of 656 YSOs from available catalogs ranging
from X-ray to the infrared. We use this as a reference set and cross-match it
to find 87 Gaia DR3 member stars to produce a control sample with revised
parameters. We queried the DR3 catalog with these parameters and found 1196
stars. We then applied three different density-based machine learning
algorithms (DBSCAN, OPTICS and HDBSCAN) to this sample and found potential
YSOs. The three clustering algorithms identified a common set of 822 YSO
members from Gaia DR3 in this region. We also classified these objects using
2MASS and WISE data to study their distribution and the progress of star
formation in Serpens.",2023-03-14T09:58:00Z
"Which Upstream Solar Wind Conditions Matter Most in Predicting Bz within
  Coronal Mass Ejections","Accurately predicting the z-component of the interplanetary magnetic field,
particularly during the passage of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection
(ICME), is a crucial objective for space weather predictions. Currently, only a
handful of techniques have been proposed and they remain limited in scope and
accuracy. Recently, a robust machine learning (ML) technique was developed for
predicting the minimum value of Bz within ICMEs based on a set of 42
'features', that is, variables calculated from measured quantities upstream of
the ICME and within its sheath region. In this study, we investigate these
so-called explanatory variables in more detail, focusing on those that were (1)
statistically significant; and (2) most important. We find that number density
and magnetic field strength accounted for a large proportion of the
variability. These features capture the degree to which the ICME compresses the
ambient solar wind ahead. Intuitively, this makes sense: Energy made available
to CMEs as they erupt is partitioned into magnetic and kinetic energy. Thus,
more powerful CMEs are launched with larger flux-rope fields (larger Bz), at
greater speeds, resulting in more sheath compression (increased number density
and total field strength).",2023-03-30T19:51:12Z
"Weisfeiler-Lehman Graph Kernel Method: A New Approach to Weak Chemical
  Tagging","Stars' chemical signatures provide invaluable insights into stellar cluster
formation. This study utilized the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) Graph Kernel to
examine a 15-dimensional elemental abundance space. Through simulating chemical
distributions using normalizing flows, the effectiveness of our algorithm was
affirmed. The results highlight the capability of the WL algorithm, coupled
with Gaussian Process Regression, to identify patterns within elemental
abundance point clouds correlated with various cluster mass functions. Notably,
the WL algorithm exhibits superior interpretability, efficacy and robustness
compared to deep sets and graph convolutional neural networks and enables
optimal training with significantly fewer simulations (O(10)), a reduction of
at least two orders of magnitude relative to graph neural networks.",2023-06-25T11:11:18Z
"Tip of the Red Giant Branch Bounds on the Neutrino Magnetic Dipole
  Moment Revisited","We use a novel method to constrain the neutrino magnetic dipole moment
($\mu_{\nu}$) using the empirically-calibrated tip of the red giant branch
I-band magnitude that fully accounts for uncertainties in stellar physics. Our
method uses machine learning to emulate the results of stellar evolution codes.
This reduces the I-Band magnitude computation time to milliseconds, which
enables a Bayesian statistical analysis where $\mu_{\nu}$ is varied
simultaneously with the stellar physics, allowing for a complete exploration of
parameter space. We find the region $\mu_{\nu} \leq
6\times10^{-12}\mu_{\textrm{B}}$ (with $\mu_{\textrm{B}}$ the Bohr magneton),
previously believed to be excluded, is unconstrained after accounting for
degeneracies with stellar physics. It is likely that larger values are
similarly unconstrained. We discuss the implications of our results for future
neutrino magnetic dipole moment searches and for other astrophysical probes.",2023-07-24T18:01:30Z
"The Plasma-prescribed Active Region Static Extrapolation (PARSE)

large set of simulated active regions for training, validation and testing
purposes. We use a state-of-the-art magnetohydrostatic extrapolation method to
develop a public dataset of over five thousand data cubes based on the
Spaceweather HMI Active Region Patch (SHARP) library of active region
magnetogram images. Each cube resolves the magnetic field vector and plasma
forcing at approximately 100,000 scattered points that are adaptively clustered
near the high-flux regions of the domain. This paper describes the methodology
of construction of the Plasma-prescribed Active Region Static Extrapolation

Hot Stellar Populations of Berkeley 39 using Swift/UVOT,"Open clusters are excellent tools to probe the history of the Galactic disk
and properties of star formation. In this work, we present a study of an old
age open cluster Berkley 39 using the observations from UVOT instrument of the
Neil Gehrels Swift observatory. Making use of a machine learning algorithm,
ML-MOC, we have identified a total of 861 stars as cluster members out of which
17 are blue straggler stars. In this work, we present a characterisation of 2
blue straggler stars. To estimate the fundamental parameters of blue straggler
stars and their companions (if any), we constructed spectral energy
distributions using UV data from swift/UVOT and GALEX, optical data from Gaia
DR3, and infrared (IR) data from 2MASS, Spitzer/IRAC, and WISE. We find excess
flux in UV in one blue straggler star, implying the possibility of a hot
companion.",2023-08-11T15:40:30Z
"Zernike moments description of solar and astronomical features: Python
  code","Due to the massive increase in astronomical images (such as James Webb and
Solar Dynamic Observatory), automatic image description is essential for solar
and astronomical. Zernike moments (ZMs) are unique due to the orthogonality and
completeness of Zernike polynomials (ZPs); hence valuable to convert a
two-dimensional image to one-dimensional series of complex numbers. The
magnitude of ZMs is rotation invariant, and by applying image normalization,
scale and translation invariants can be made, which are helpful properties for
describing solar and astronomical images. In this package, we describe the
characteristics of ZMs via several examples of solar (large and small scale)
features and astronomical images. ZMs can describe the structure and morphology
of objects in an image to apply machine learning to identify and track the
features in several disciplines.",2023-08-24T21:14:30Z
"Characterisation of high velocity stars in the S-PLUS internal fourth
  data release","In general, the atypical high velocity of some stars in the Galaxy can only
be explained by invoking acceleration mechanisms related to extreme
astrophysical events in the Milky Way. Using astrometric data from Gaia and the
photometric information in 12 filters of the S-PLUS, we performed a kinematic,
dynamical, and chemical analysis of 64 stars with galactocentric velocities
higher than 400 $\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$. All the stars are gravitationally bound
to the Galaxy and exhibit halo kinematics. Some of the stars could be remnants
of structures such as the Sequoia and the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus. Supported by
orbital and chemical analysis, we identified Gaia DR3 5401875170994688896 as a
star likely to be originated at the centre of the Galaxy. Application of a
machine learning technique to the S-PLUS photometric data allows us to obtain
very good estimates of magnesium abundances for this sample of high velocity
stars.",2023-11-20T17:22:35Z
Period-Luminosity Relationship for $δ$ Scuti Stars Revisited,"The Gaia DR3 parallax approach was used to estimate the absolute parameters
of 2375 Delta Scuti stars from the ASAS catalog. The selected stars have a
variety of observational characteristics, with a higher than 80% probability of
being Delta Scuti stars. We have displayed all the stars in the
Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram along with the Delta Scuti instability strip,
the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS), and the Terminal-Age Main Sequence (TAMS).
Then, we determined which fundamental and overtone modes each star belongs to
using pulsation constant (Q) calculations. In addition, we evaluated the
parameters in the Q calculation equation using three machine learning methods,
which showed that surface gravity and temperature have the greatest effect on
its calculation. The Period-Luminosity (P-L) relationship of the Delta Scuti
stars was also revisited. Eventually, using least squares linear regression, we
made four linear fits for fundamental and overtone modes and updated their
relationships.",2024-01-02T08:22:52Z
Whither or wither the Sulfur Anomaly in Planetary Nebulae?,"We present a thorough investigation of the long standing sulfur anomaly
enigma. Our analysis uses chemical abundances from the most extensive dataset
available for 126 planetary nebulae (PNe) with improved accuracy and reduced
uncertainties from a 10x10 degree Galactic bulge region. By using argon as a
superior PNe metallicity indicator, the anomaly is significantly reduced and
better constrained. For the first time in PNe we show sulfur alpha-element
lock-step with both oxygen and argon. We dispel hypotheses that the anomaly
originates from underestimation of higher sulfur ionization stages. Using a
machine learning approach, we show that earlier ionization correction factor
(ICFs) schemes contributed significantly to the anomaly. We find a correlation
between the sulfur anomaly and the age/mass of PNe progenitors, with the
anomaly either absent or significantly reduced in PNe with young progenitors.
Despite inherent challenges and uncertainties, we link this to PNe dust
chemistry, noting those with carbon-dust chemistry show a more pronounced
anomaly. By integrating these findings, we provide a plausible explanation for
the residual, reduced sulfur anomaly and propose its potential as an indicator
of relative galaxy age compositions based on PNe.",2024-01-17T07:33:45Z
Using GMM in Open Cluster Membership: An Insight,"The unprecedented precision of Gaia has led to a paradigm shift in membership
determination of open clusters where a variety of machine learning (ML) models
can be employed. In this paper, we apply the unsupervised Gaussian Mixture
Model (GMM) to a sample of thirteen clusters with varying ages ($log \ t
\approx$ 6.38-9.64) and distances (441-5183 pc) from Gaia DR3 data to determine
membership. We use ASteca to determine parameters for the clusters from our
revised membership data. We define a quantifiable metric Modified Silhouette
Score (MSS) to evaluate its performance. We study the dependence of MSS on age,
distance, extinction, galactic latitude and longitude, and other parameters to
find the particular cases when GMM seems to be more efficient than other
methods. We compared GMM for nine clusters with varying ages but we did not
find any significant differences between GMM performance for younger and older
clusters. But we found a moderate correlation between GMM performance and the
cluster distance, where GMM works better for closer clusters. We find that GMM
does not work very well for clusters at distances larger than 3~kpc.",2024-01-19T16:40:04Z
Constructing the three-dimensional extinction density maps using V-net,"One of the major challenges we face is how to quickly and accurately create
the three-dimensional (3D) density distributions of interstellar dust in the
Milky Way using extinction and distance measurements of large samples of stars.
In this study, we introduce a novel machine-learning approach that utilizes a
convolution neural network, specifically a V-net, to infer the 3D distribution
of dust density. Experiments are performed within two regions located towards
the Galactic anti-center. The neural network is trained and tested using 10,000
simulations of dust density and line-of-sight extinction maps. Evaluation of
the test sample confirms the successful generation of dust density maps from
extinction maps by our model. Additionally, the performance of the trained
network is evaluated using data from the literature. Our results demonstrate
that our model is capable of capturing detailed dust density variations and can
recover dust density maps while reducing the ``fingers of god"" effect. Moving
forward, we plan to apply this model to real observational data to obtain the
fine distribution of dust at large and small scales in the Milky Way.",2024-02-17T13:01:21Z
"Developing an Automated Detection, Tracking and Analysis Method for
  Solar Filaments Observed by CHASE via Machine Learning","Studies on the dynamics of solar filaments have significant implications for
understanding their formation, evolution, and eruption, which are of great
importance for space weather warning and forecasting. The H$\alpha$ Imaging
Spectrograph (HIS) onboard the recently launched Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar
Explorer (CHASE) can provide full-disk solar H$\alpha$ spectroscopic
observations, which bring us an opportunity to systematically explore and
analyze the plasma dynamics of filaments. The dramatically increased
observation data require automate processing and analysis which are impossible
if dealt with manually. In this paper, we utilize the U-Net model to identify
filaments and implement the Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracking (CSRT)
algorithm for automated filament tracking. In addition, we use the cloud model
to invert the line-of-sight velocity of filaments and employ the graph theory
algorithm to extract the filament spine, which can advance our understanding of
the dynamics of filaments. The favorable test performance confirms the validity
of our method, which will be implemented in the following statistical analyses
of filament features and dynamics of CHASE/HIS observations.",2024-02-22T01:22:19Z
"Membership determination in open clusters using the DBSCAN Clustering
  Algorithm","In this paper, we apply the machine learning clustering algorithm Density
Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to study the
membership of stars in twelve open clusters (NGC~2264, NGC~2682, NGC~2244,
NGC~3293, NGC~6913, NGC~7142, IC~1805, NGC~6231, NGC~2243, NGC 6451, NGC 6005
and NGC 6583) based on Gaia DR3 Data. This sample of clusters spans a variety
of parameters like age, metallicity, distance, extinction and a wide parameter
space in proper motions and parallaxes. We obtain reliable cluster members
using DBSCAN as faint as $G \sim 20$ mag and also in the outer regions of
clusters. With our revised membership list, we plot color-magnitude diagrams
and we obtain cluster parameters for our sample using ASteCA and compare it
with the catalog values. We also validate our membership sample by
spectroscopic data from APOGEE and GALAH for the available data. This paper
demonstrates the effectiveness of DBSCAN in membership determination of
clusters.",2024-04-16T11:38:55Z
"Characterizing NGC 6383: A study of pre-main sequence stars, mass
  segregation, and age using Gaia DR3 and 2MASS","This study employs Bayesian analysis and machine learning techniques to
analyze the young open cluster NGC 6383 using data from Gaia DR3 and 2MASS. We
identified 254 probable cluster members through HDBSCAN based on proper motions
and determined the cluster's core and tidal radius. To perform this analysis,
we utilized an extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, the No-U-Turn Sampler,
using the Bayesian library PyMC. Our results indicate a mean cluster age of $4
\pm 1$ Myr and a distance of $1.107 \pm 0.035$ kpc. The analysis reveals mass
segregation, especially among binary stars, and suggests that NGC 6383 is not
fully relaxed. We observed a well-defined main sequence and a population of
pre-main sequence stars, with a star formation range from $\sim 1$ to $6$ Myr,
indicating recent star formation activity.",2024-05-15T07:18:32Z
"The APOKASC Catalog: An Asteroseismic and Spectroscopic Joint Survey of
  Targets in the Kepler Fields","We present the first APOKASC catalog of spectroscopic and asteroseismic
properties of 1916 red giants observed in the Kepler fields. The spectroscopic
parameters provided from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution
Experiment project are complemented with asteroseismic surface gravities,
masses, radii, and mean densities determined by members of the Kepler
Asteroseismology Science Consortium. We assess both random and systematic
sources of error and include a discussion of sample selection for giants in the
Kepler fields. Total uncertainties in the main catalog properties are of order
80 K in Teff , 0.06 dex in [M/H], 0.014 dex in log g, and 12% and 5% in mass
and radius, respectively; these reflect a combination of systematic and random
errors. Asteroseismic surface gravities are substantially more precise and
accurate than spectroscopic ones, and we find good agreement between their mean
values and the calibrated spectroscopic surface gravities. There are, however,
systematic underlying trends with Teff and log g. Our effective temperature
scale is between 0-200 K cooler than that expected from the Infrared Flux
Method, depending on the adopted extinction map, which provides evidence for a
lower value on average than that inferred for the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC).
We find a reasonable correspondence between the photometric KIC and
spectroscopic APOKASC metallicity scales, with increased dispersion in KIC
metallicities as the absolute metal abundance decreases, and offsets in Teff
and log g consistent with those derived in the literature. We present mean
fitting relations between APOKASC and KIC observables and discuss future
prospects, strengths, and limitations of the catalog data.",2014-10-09T15:10:12Z
The AllWISE Motion Survey and The Quest for Cold Subdwarfs,"The AllWISE processing pipeline has measured motions for all objects detected
on WISE images taken between 2010 January and 2011 February. In this paper, we
discuss new capabilities made to the software pipeline in order to make motion
measurements possible, and we characterize the resulting data products for use
by future researchers. Using a stringent set of selection criteria, we find
22,445 objects that have significant AllWISE motions, of which 3,525 have
motions that can be independently confirmed from earlier 2MASS images yet lack
any published motions in SIMBAD. Another 58 sources lack 2MASS counterparts and
are presented as motion candidates only. Limited spectroscopic follow-up of
this list has already revealed eight new L subdwarfs. These may provide the
first hints of a ""subdwarf gap"" at mid-L types that would indicate the break
between the stellar and substellar populations at low metallicities (i.e., old
ages). Another object in the motion list -- WISEA J154045.67-510139.3 -- is a
bright (J ~ 9 mag) object of type M6; both the spectrophotometric distance and
a crude preliminary parallax place it ~6 pc from the Sun. We also compare our
list of motion objects to the recently published list of 762 WISE motion
objects from Luhman (2014). While these first large motion studies with WISE
data have been very successful in revealing previously overlooked nearby
dwarfs, both studies missed objects that the other found, demonstrating that
many other nearby objects likely await discovery in the AllWISE data products.",2014-02-04T08:55:23Z
"Exploring the Variable Sky with LINEAR. III. Classification of Periodic
  Light Curves","We describe the construction of a highly reliable sample of approximately
7,000 optically faint periodic variable stars with light curves obtained by the
asteroid survey LINEAR across 10,000 sq.deg of northern sky. Majority of these
variables have not been cataloged yet. The sample flux limit is several
magnitudes fainter than for most other wide-angle surveys; the photometric
errors range from ~0.03 mag at $r=15$ to ~0.20 mag at r=18. Light curves
include on average 250 data points, collected over about a decade. Using
SDSS-based photometric recalibration of the LINEAR data for about 25 million
objects, we selected ~200,000 most probable candidate variables and visually
confirmed and classified approximately 7,000 periodic variables using phased
light curves. The reliability and uniformity of visual classification across
eight human classifiers was calibrated and tested using a SDSS Stripe 82 region
variable star catalog, and verified using an unsupervised machine learning
approach. The resulting sample of periodic LINEAR variables is dominated by
3,900 RR Lyrae stars and 2,700 eclipsing binary stars of all subtypes, and
includes small fractions of relatively rare populations such as asymptotic
giant branch stars and SX Phoenicis stars. We discuss the distribution of these
mostly uncataloged variables in various diagrams constructed with
optical-to-infrared SDSS, 2MASS and WISE photometry, and with LINEAR light
curve features. An interesting side result is a robust and precise quantitative
description of a strong correlation between the light-curve period and
color/spectral type for close and contact eclipsing binary stars. These large
samples of robustly classified variable stars will enable detailed statistical
studies of the Galactic structure and physics of binary and other stars, and we
make them publicly available.",2013-08-01T21:06:33Z
"Measuring Young Stars in Space and Time -- II. The Pre-Main-Sequence
  Stellar Content of N44","The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) survey Measuring Young Stars in Space and
Time (MYSST) entails some of the deepest photometric observations of
extragalactic star formation, capturing even the lowest mass stars of the
active star-forming complex N44 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We employ the
new MYSST stellar catalog to identify and characterize the content of young
pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars across N44 and analyze the PMS clustering
structure. To distinguish PMS stars from more evolved line of sight
contaminants, a non-trivial task due to several effects that alter photometry,
we utilize a machine learning classification approach. This consists of
training a support vector machine (SVM) and a random forest (RF) on a carefully
selected subset of the MYSST data and categorize all observed stars as PMS or
non-PMS. Combining SVM and RF predictions to retrieve the most robust set of
PMS sources, we find $\sim26,700$ candidates with a PMS probability above 95%
across N44. Employing a clustering approach based on a nearest neighbor surface
density estimate, we identify 18 prominent PMS structures at $1$ $\sigma$
significance above the mean density with sub-clusters persisting up to and
beyond $3$ $\sigma$ significance. The most active star-forming center, located
at the western edge of N44's bubble, is a subcluster with an effective radius
of $\sim 5.6$ pc entailing more than 1,100 PMS candidates. Furthermore, we
confirm that almost all identified clusters coincide with known H II regions
and are close to or harbor massive young O stars or YSOs previously discovered
by MUSE and Spitzer observations.",2020-12-01T14:33:44Z
"Predicting Solar Proton Events of Solar Cycles 22-24 using GOES Proton &
  soft X-Ray flux features","Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events and their major subclass, Solar Proton
Events (SPEs), can have unfavorable consequences on numerous aspects of life
and technology, making them one of the most harmful effects of solar activity.
Garnering knowledge preceding such events by studying operational data flows is
essential for their forecasting. Considering only Solar Cycle (SC) 24 in our
previous study, Sadykov et al. 2021, we found that it may be sufficient to
utilize only proton and soft X-ray (SXR) parameters for SPE forecasts. Here, we
report a catalog recording $\geq$ 10 MeV $\geq$ 10 particle flux unit SPEs with
their properties, spanning SCs 22-24, using NOAA's Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite flux data. We report an additional catalog of daily
proton and SXR flux statistics for this period, employing it to test the
application of machine learning (ML) on the prediction of SPEs using a Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We explore the
effects of training models with data from one and two SCs, evaluating how
transferable a model can be across different time periods. XGBoost proved to be
more accurate than SVMs for almost every test considered, while outperforming
operational SWPC NOAA predictions and a persistence forecast. Interestingly,
training done with SC 24 produces weaker TSS and HSS2, even when paired with SC
22 or SC 23, indicating transferability issues. This work contributes towards
validating forecasts using long-spanning data -- an understudied area in SEP
research that should be considered to verify the cross-cycle robustness of
ML-driven forecasts.",2023-03-09T17:45:34Z
"TESS Stellar Rotation up to 80 days in the Southern Continuous Viewing
  Zone","The TESS mission delivers time-series photometry for millions of stars across
the sky, offering a probe into stellar astrophysics, including rotation, on a
population scale. However, light curve systematics related to the satellite's
13.7-day orbit have prevented stellar rotation searches for periods longer than
13 days, putting the majority of stars beyond reach. Machine learning methods
have the ability to identify systematics and recover robust signals, enabling
us to recover rotation periods up to 35 days for GK dwarfs and 80 days for M
dwarfs. We present a catalog of 7245 rotation periods for cool dwarfs in the
Southern Continuous Viewing Zone, estimated using convolutional neural
networks. We find evidence for structure in the period distribution consistent
with prior Kepler and K2 results, including a gap in 10--20-day cool star
periods thought to arise from a change in stellar spin-down or activity. Using
a combination of spectroscopic and gyrochronologic constraints, we fit stellar
evolution models to estimate masses and ages for stars with rotation periods.
We find strong correlations between the detectability of rotation in TESS and
the effective temperature, age, and metallicity of the stars. Finally, we
investigate the relationships between rotation and newly obtained spot filling
fractions estimated from APOGEE spectra. Field star spot filling fractions are
elevated in the same temperature and period regime where open clusters'
magnetic braking stalls, lending support to an internal shear mechanism that
can produce both phenomena.",2023-07-11T18:00:00Z
"Photometric segregation of dwarf and giant FGK stars using the SVO
  Filter Profile Service and photometric tools","This paper is focused on the segregation of FGK dwarf and giant stars through
narrow-band photometric data using the Spanish Virtual Observatory (SVO) Filter
Profile Service and associated photometric tools. We selected spectra from the
MILES, STELIB, and ELODIE stellar libraries, and used SVO photometric tools to
derive the synthetic photometry in 15 J-PAS narrow filters, which were
especially selected to cover spectral features sensitive to gravity changes.
Using machine-learning techniques as the Gaussian mixture model and the support
vector machine, we defined several criteria based on J-PAS colours to
discriminate between dwarf and giant stars. We selected five colour-colour
diagrams that presented the most promising separation between both samples. Our
results show an overall accuracy in the studied sample of $\sim$0.97 for FGK
stars, although a dependence on the luminosity type and the stellar effective
temperature was found. We also defined a colour-temperature relation for dwarf
stars with effective temperatures between 4\,000 and 7\,000\,K, which allows
one to estimate the stellar effective temperature from four J-PAS filters
($J0450$, $J0510$, $J0550$, and $J0620$). Additionally, we extended the study
to M-type giant and dwarf stars, achieving a similar accuracy to that for FGK
stars.",2024-06-05T14:23:13Z
SunPy - Python for Solar Physics,"This paper presents SunPy (version 0.5), a community-developed Python package
for solar physics. Python, a free, cross-platform, general-purpose, high-level
programming language, has seen widespread adoption among the scientific
community, resulting in the availability of a large number of software
packages, from numerical computation (NumPy, SciPy) and machine learning
(scikit-learn) to visualisation and plotting (matplotlib). SunPy is a
data-analysis environment specialising in providing the software necessary to
analyse solar and heliospheric data in Python. SunPy is open-source software
(BSD licence) and has an open and transparent development workflow that anyone
can contribute to. SunPy provides access to solar data through integration with
the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO), the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase
(HEK), and the HELiophysics Integrated Observatory (HELIO) webservices. It
currently supports image data from major solar missions (e.g., SDO, SOHO,
STEREO, and IRIS), time-series data from missions such as GOES, SDO/EVE, and
PROBA2/LYRA, and radio spectra from e-Callisto and STEREO/SWAVES. We describe
SunPy's functionality, provide examples of solar data analysis in SunPy, and
show how Python-based solar data-analysis can leverage the many existing tools
already available in Python. We discuss the future goals of the project and
encourage interested users to become involved in the planning and development
of SunPy.",2015-05-11T10:55:31Z
"The Random Hivemind: An Ensemble Deep Learner Application to Solar
  Energetic Particle Prediction Problem","The application of machine learning and deep learning, including the wide use
of non-ensemble, conventional neural networks (CoNN), for predicting various
phenomena has become very popular in recent years thanks to the efficiencies
and the abilities of these techniques to find relationships in data without
human intervention. However, certain CoNN setups may not work on some datasets,
especially if the parameters passed to it, including model parameters and
hyperparameters, are arguably arbitrary in nature and need to continuously be
updated with the need to retrain the model. This concern can be partially
alleviated by employing committees of neural networks that are identical in
terms of input features and architectures, initialized randomly, and ""vote"" on
the decisions made by the committees as a whole. Yet, it is possible for the
committee members to ""agree"" on identical sets of weights and biases for all
nodes and edges. Members of these committees also cannot be expanded to
accommodate new features and entire committees must therefore be retrained in
order to do so. We propose the Random Hivemind (RH) approach, which helps to
alleviate this concern by having multiple neural network estimators make
decisions based on random permutations of features and prescribing a method to
determine the weight of the decision of each individual estimator. The
effectiveness of RH is demonstrated through experimentation in the predictions
of hazardous Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events by comparing it to that of
using both CoNNs and the aforementioned setup of committees. Our results
demonstrate that RH, while having a comparable or better performance than the
CoNN and a Committee-based approach, demonstrates a lesser score spread for the
individual experiments, and shows promising results with respect to capturing
almost every single flare instance leading to SEPs.",2023-03-14T17:30:36Z
"Search for carbon stars and DZ white dwarfs in SDSS spectra survey
  through machine learning","Carbon stars and DZ white dwarfs are two types of rare objects in the Galaxy.
In this paper, we have applied the label propagation algorithm to search for
these two types of stars from Data Release Eight (DR8) of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS), which is verified to be efficient by calculating precision and
recall. From nearly two million spectra including stars, galaxies and QSOs, we
have found 260 new carbon stars in which 96 stars have been identified as
dwarfs and 7 identified as giants, and 11 composition spectrum systems (each of
them consists of a white dwarf and a carbon star). Similarly, using the label
propagation method, we have obtained 29 new DZ white dwarfs from SDSS DR8.
Compared with PCA reconstructed spectra, the 29 findings are typical DZ white
dwarfs. We have also investigated their proper motions by comparing them with
proper motion distribution of 9,374 white dwarfs, and found that they satisfy
the current observed white dwarfs by SDSS generally have large proper motions.
In addition, we have estimated their effective temperatures by fitting the
polynomial relationship between effective temperature and g-r color of known DZ
white dwarfs, and found 12 of the 29 new DZ white dwarfs are cool, in which
nine are between 6000K and 6600K, and three are below 6000K.",2013-09-07T16:54:11Z
A Classifier to Detect Elusive Astronomical Objects through Photometry,"The application of machine learning principles in the photometric search of
elusive astronomical objects has been a less-explored frontier of research.
Here we have used three methods: the Neural Network and two variants of
k-Nearest Neighbour, to identify brown dwarf candidates using the photometric
colours of known brown dwarfs. We initially check the efficiencies of these
three classification techniques, both individually and collectively, on known
objects. This is followed by their application to three regions in the sky,
namely Hercules (2 deg x 2 deg), Serpens (9 deg x 4 deg) and Lyra (2 deg x 2
deg). Testing these algorithms on sets of objects that include known brown
dwarfs shows a high level of completeness. This includes the Hercules and
Serpens regions where brown dwarfs have been detected. We use these methods to
search and identify brown dwarf candidates towards the Lyra region. We infer
that the collective method of classification, also known as ensemble
classifier, is highly efficient in the identification of brown dwarf
candidates.",2019-07-01T07:39:40Z
"Untangling the Galaxy I: Local Structure and Star Formation History of
  the Milky Way","Gaia DR2 provides unprecedented precision in measurements of the distance and
kinematics of stars in the solar neighborhood. Through applying unsupervised
machine learning on DR2's 5-dimensional dataset (3d position + 2d velocity), we
identify a number of clusters, associations, and co-moving groups within 1 kpc
and $|b|<30^\circ$ (many of which have not been previously known). We estimate
their ages with the precision of $\sim$0.15 dex. Many of these groups appear to
be filamentary or string-like, oriented in parallel to the Galactic plane, and
some span hundreds of pc in length. Most of these string lack a central
cluster, indicating that their filamentary structure is primordial, rather than
the result of tidal stripping or dynamical processing. The youngest strings
($<$100 Myr) are orthogonal to the Local Arm. The older ones appear to be
remnants of several other arm-like structures that cannot be presently traced
by dust and gas. The velocity dispersion measured from the ensemble of groups
and strings increase with age, suggesting a timescale for dynamical heating of
$\sim$300 Myr. This timescale is also consistent with the age at which the
population of strings begins to decline, while the population in more compact
groups continues to increase, suggesting that dynamical processes are
disrupting the weakly bound string populations, leaving only individual
clusters to be identified at the oldest ages. These data shed a new light on
the local galactic structure and a large scale cloud collapse.",2019-07-17T18:28:56Z
"Real-time solar image classification: assessing spectral, pixel-based
  approaches","In order to utilize solar imagery for real-time feature identification and
large-scale data science investigations of solar structures, we need maps of
the Sun where phenomena, or themes, are labeled. Since solar imagers produce
observations every few minutes, it is not feasible to label all images by hand.
Here, we compare three machine learning algorithms performing solar image
classification using extreme ultraviolet and Hydrogen-alpha images: a maximum
likelihood model assuming a single normal probability distribution for each
theme from Rigler et al. (2012), a maximum-likelihood model with an underlying
Gaussian mixtures distribution, and a random forest model. We create a small
database of expert-labeled maps to train and test these algorithms. Due to the
ambiguity between the labels created by different experts, a collaborative
labeling is used to include all inputs. We find the random forest algorithm
performs the best amongst the three algorithms. The advantages of this
algorithm are best highlighted in: comparison of outputs to hand-drawn maps;
response to short-term variability; and tracking long-term changes on the Sun.
Our work indicates that the next generation of solar image classification
algorithms would benefit significantly from using spatial structure
recognition, compared to only using spectral, pixel-by-pixel brightness
distributions.",2019-09-30T22:48:02Z
"Diagnosing the Stellar Population and Tidal Structure of the Blanco1
  Star Cluster","We present the stellar population, using {\it Gaia}\,DR2 parallax,
kinematics, and photometry, of the young ($\sim 100$~Myr), nearby ($\sim
230$~pc) open cluster, Blanco1. A total of 644 member candidates are identified
via the unsupervised machine learning method \textsc{StarGO} to find the
clustering in the 5-dimensional position and proper motion parameter ($X$, $Y$,
$Z$, $\mu_\alpha \cos\delta$, $\mu_\delta$) space. Within the tidal radius of
$10.0 \pm 0.3$~pc, there are 488 member candidates, 3 times more than those
outside. A leading tail and a trailing tail, each of 50--60~pc in the Galactic
plane, are found for the first time for this cluster, with stars further from
the cluster center streaming away faster, manifest stellar stripping. Blanco1
has a total detected mass of $285\pm32$~M$_\odot $ with a mass function
consistent with a slope of $\alpha=1.35\pm0.2$ in the sense of $dN/dm \propto
m^{-\alpha}$, in the mass range of 0.25--2.51~M$_\odot $, where $N$ is the
number of members and $m$ is stellar mass. A Minimum Spanning Tree
($\Lambda_{\rm MSR}$) analysis shows the cluster to be moderately mass
segregated among the most massive members ($\gtrsim 1.4$~M$_\odot$), suggesting
an early stage of dynamical disintegration.",2019-12-13T19:00:00Z
A Framework for Designing and Evaluating Solar Flare Forecasting Systems,"Disturbances in space weather can negatively affect several fields, including
aviation and aerospace, satellites, oil and gas industries, and electrical
systems, leading to economic and commercial losses. Solar flares are the most
significant events that can affect the Earth's atmosphere, thus leading
researchers to drive efforts on their forecasting. The related literature is
comprehensive and holds several systems proposed for flare forecasting.
However, most techniques are tailor-made and designed for specific purposes,
not allowing researchers to customize them in case of changes in data input or
in the prediction algorithm. This paper proposes a framework to design, train,
and evaluate flare prediction systems which present promising results. Our
proposed framework involves model and feature selection, randomized
hyper-parameters optimization, data resampling, and evaluation under
operational settings. Compared to baseline predictions, our framework generated
some proof-of-concept models with positive recalls between 0.70 and 0.75 for
forecasting $\geq M$ class flares up to 96 hours ahead while keeping the area
under the ROC curve score at high levels.",2020-05-05T21:05:10Z
"The VVV Open Cluster Project. Near-infrared sequences of NGC6067,
  NGC6259, NGC4815, Pismis18, Trumpler23, and Trumpler20","Open clusters are central elements of our understanding of the Galactic disk
evolution, as an accurate determination of their parameters leads to an
unbiased picture of our Galaxy's structure. Extending the analysis towards
fainter magnitudes in cluster sequences has a significant impact on the derived
fundamental parameters, such as extinction and total mass. We perform a
homogeneous analysis of six open stellar clusters in the Galactic disk using
kinematic and photometric information from the Gaia DR2 and VVV surveys:
NGC6067, NGC6259, NGC4815, Pismis18, Trumpler23, and Trumpler20. We implement
two coarse-to-fine characterization methods: first, we employ Gaussian mixture
models to tag fields around each open cluster in the proper motion space, and
then we apply an unsupervised machine learning method to make the membership
assignment to each cluster. For the studied clusters, with ages in the
$\sim$120-1900 Myr range, we report an increase of $\sim$45 % new member
candidates on average in our sample. The data-driven selection approach of
cluster members makes our catalog a valuable resource for testing stellar
evolutionary models and for assessing the cluster low-to-intermediate mass
populations. This study is the first of a series intended to homogeneously
reveal open cluster near-infrared sequences.",2021-02-08T16:07:29Z
The ZTF Source Classification Project: I. Methods and Infrastructure,"The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) has been observing the entire northern
sky since the start of 2018 down to a magnitude of 20.5 ($5 \sigma$ for 30s
exposure) in $g$, $r$, and $i$ filters. Over the course of two years, ZTF has
obtained light curves of more than a billion sources, each with 50-1000 epochs
per light curve in $g$ and $r$, and fewer in $i$. To be able to use the
information contained in the light curves of variable sources for new
scientific discoveries, an efficient and flexible framework is needed to
classify them. In this paper, we introduce the methods and infrastructure which
will be used to classify all ZTF light curves. Our approach aims to be flexible
and modular and allows the use of a dynamical classification scheme and labels,
continuously evolving training sets, and the use of different machine learning
classifier types and architectures. With this setup, we are able to
continuously update and improve the classification of ZTF light curves as new
data becomes available, training samples are updated, and new classes need to
be incorporated.",2021-02-22T19:01:21Z
"Mass and Age of Red Giant Branch Stars Observed with LAMOST and
  \emph{Kepler}","Obtaining accurate and precise masses and ages for large numbers of giant
stars is of great importance for unraveling the assemblage history of the
Galaxy. In this paper, we estimate masses and ages of 6940 red giant branch
(RGB) stars with asteroseismic parameters deduced from \emph{Kepler} photometry
and stellar atmospheric parameters derived from LAMOST spectra. The typical
uncertainties of mass is a few per cent, and that of age is $\sim$\,20 per
cent. The sample stars reveal two separate sequences in the age --
[$\alpha$/Fe] relation -- a high--$\alpha$ sequence with stars older than
$\sim$\,8\,Gyr and a low--$\alpha$ sequence composed of stars with ages ranging
from younger than 1\,Gyr to older than 11\,Gyr. We further investigate the
feasibility of deducing ages and masses directly from LAMOST spectra with a
machine learning method based on kernel based principal component analysis,
taking a sub-sample of these RGB stars as a training data set. We demonstrate
that ages thus derived achieve an accuracy of $\sim$\,24 per cent. We also
explored the feasibility of estimating ages and masses based on the
spectroscopically measured carbon and nitrogen abundances.
  The results are quite satisfactory and significantly improved compared to the
previous studies.",2017-12-28T06:52:12Z
"Assessing the performance of LTE and NLTE synthetic stellar spectra in a
  machine learning framework","In the current era of stellar spectroscopic surveys, synthetic spectral
libraries are the basis for the derivation of stellar parameters and chemical
abundances. In this paper, we compare the stellar parameters determined using
five popular synthetic spectral grids (INTRIGOSS, FERRE, AMBRE, PHOENIX, and
MPIA/1DNLTE) with our convolutional neural network (CNN, $\texttt{StarNet}$).
The stellar parameters are determined for six physical properties (effective
temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, [$\alpha$/Fe], radial velocity, and
rotational velocity) given the spectral resolution, signal-to-noise, and
wavelength range of optical FLAMES-UVES spectra from the Gaia-ESO Survey. Both
CNN modelling and epistemic uncertainties are incorporated through training an
ensemble of networks. $\texttt{StarNet}$ training was also adapted to mitigate
differences between the synthetic grids and observed spectra by augmenting with
realistic observational signatures (i.e. resolution matching, wavelength
sampling, Gaussian noise, zeroing flux values, rotational and radial
velocities, continuum removal, and masking telluric regions). Using the
FLAMES-UVES spectra for FGK type dwarfs and giants as a test set, we quantify
the accuracy and precision of the stellar label predictions from
$\texttt{StarNet}$. We find excellent results over a wide range of parameters
when $\texttt{StarNet}$ is trained on the MPIA/1DNLTE synthetic grid, and
acceptable results over smaller parameter ranges when trained on the 1DLTE
grids. These tests also show that our CNN pipeline is highly adaptable to
multiple simulation grids.",2019-11-06T19:33:27Z
"Using gradient boosting regression to improve ambient solar wind model
  predictions","Studying the ambient solar wind, a continuous pressure-driven plasma flow
emanating from our Sun, is an important component of space weather research.
The ambient solar wind flows in interplanetary space determine how solar storms
evolve through the heliosphere before reaching Earth, and especially during
solar minimum are themselves a driver of activity in the Earth's magnetic
field. Accurately forecasting the ambient solar wind flow is therefore
imperative to space weather awareness. Here we present a machine learning
approach in which solutions from magnetic models of the solar corona are used
to output the solar wind conditions near the Earth. The results are compared to
observations and existing models in a comprehensive validation analysis, and
the new model outperforms existing models in almost all measures. In addition,
this approach offers a new perspective to discuss the role of different input
data to ambient solar wind modeling, and what this tells us about the
underlying physical processes. The final model discussed here represents an
extremely fast, well-validated and open-source approach to the forecasting of
ambient solar wind at Earth.",2020-06-23T08:50:56Z
Probabilistic Reconstruction of Type Ia Supernova SN 2002bo,"Manual fits to spectral times series of Type Ia supernovae have provided a
method of reconstructing the explosion from a parametric model but due to lack
of information about model uncertainties or parameter degeneracies direct
comparison between theory and observation is difficult. In order to mitigate
this important problem we present a new way to probabilistically reconstruct
the outer ejecta of the normal Type Ia supernova SN 2002bo. A single epoch
spectrum, taken 10 days before maximum light, is fit by a 13-parameter model
describing the elemental composition of the ejecta and the explosion physics
(density, temperature, velocity, and explosion epoch). Model evaluation is
performed through the application of a novel rapid spectral synthesis technique
in which the radiative transfer code, TARDIS, is accelerated by a
machine-learning framework. Analysis of the posterior distribution reveals a
complex and degenerate parameter space and allows direct comparison to various
hydrodynamic models. Our analysis favors detonation over deflagration scenarios
and we find that our technique offers a novel way to compare simulation to
observation.",2021-05-17T14:47:02Z
Metallicity estimation of RR Lyrae stars from their I-band light curves,"We have revisited the problem of metallicity prediction of RR Lyrae stars
from their near-infrared light curves in the Cousins I waveband. Our study is
based on high-quality time-series photometry and state-of-the-art
high-resolution spectroscopic abundance measurements of 80 fundamental-mode
(RRab) and 24 first-overtone (RRc) stars, spanning $\sim$[$-2.7$,$+0.18$] dex
and $\sim$[$-3$,$-0.5$] dex ranges, respectively. Employing machine-learning
methods, we investigated various light-curve representations and regression
models to identify their optimal form for our objective. Accurate new empirical
relations between the [Fe/H] iron abundance and the light-curve parameters have
been obtained using Bayesian regression for both RRab and RRc stars with mean
absolute prediction errors of 0.16 and 0.18 dex, respectively. We found that
earlier $I$-band [Fe/H] estimates had a systematic positive bias of up to $\sim
0.4$ dex in the metal-poor regime. Our new predictive models were deployed on
large ensembles of RR Lyrae stars to obtain photometric metallicity
distribution functions (MDFs) for various old stellar populations in and around
the Milky Way. We find that the mode of the old bulge component's MDF is
approximately $-1.4$ dex, in remarkable agreement with the latest spectroscopic
result. Furthermore, we derive MDF modes of $-1.83$, $-2.13$, and $-1.77$ dex
for the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, and the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy,
respectively.",2021-07-13T11:04:03Z
"A 'Quick Look' at All-Sky Galactic Archeology with TESS: 158,000
  Oscillating Red Giants from the MIT Quick-Look Pipeline","We present the first near all-sky yield of oscillating red giants from the
prime mission data of NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We
apply machine learning towards long-cadence TESS photometry from the first data
release by the MIT Quick-Look Pipeline to automatically detect the presence of
red giant oscillations in frequency power spectra. The detected targets are
conservatively vetted to produce a total of 158,505 oscillating red giants,
which is an order of magnitude increase over the yield from Kepler and K2 and a
lower limit to the possible yield of oscillating giants across TESS's nominal
mission. For each detected target, we report effective temperatures and radii
derived from colors and Gaia parallaxes, as well as estimates of their
frequency at maximum oscillation power. Using our measurements, we present the
first near all-sky Gaia-asteroseismology mass map, which shows global
structures consistent with the expected stellar populations of our Galaxy. To
demonstrate the strong potential of TESS asteroseismology for Galactic
archeology even with only one month of observations, we identify 354 new
candidates for oscillating giants in the Galactic halo, display the vertical
mass gradient of the Milky Way disk, and visualize correlations of stellar
masses with kinematic phase space substructures, velocity dispersions, and
$\alpha$-abundances.",2021-08-03T01:39:34Z
"Beyond the Local Volume. I. Surface Densities of Ultracool Dwarfs in
  Deep HST/WFC3 Parallel Fields","Ultracool dwarf stars and brown dwarfs provide a unique probe of large-scale
Galactic structure and evolution; however, until recently spectroscopic samples
of sufficient size, depth, and fidelity have been unavailable. Here, we present
the identification of 164 M7--T9 ultracool dwarfs in 0.6~deg$^2$ of deep,
low-resolution, near-infrared spectroscopic data obtained with the Hubble Space
Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 instrument as part of the WFC3 Infrared
Spectroscopic Parallel Survey and the 3D-HST survey. We describe the
methodology by which we isolate ultracool dwarf candidates from over 200,000
spectra, and show that selection by machine learning classification is superior
to spectral index-based methods in terms of completeness and contamination. We
use the spectra to accurately determine classifications and spectrophotometric
distances, the latter reaching to ~2 kpc for L dwarfs and ~400pc for T dwarfs.",2021-10-14T19:05:01Z
"Decreasing False Alarm Rates in ML-based Solar Flare Prediction using
  SDO/HMI Data","A hybrid two-stage machine learning architecture that addresses the problem
of excessive false positives (false alarms) in solar flare prediction systems
is investigated. The first stage is a convolutional neural network (CNN) model
based on the VGG-16 architecture that extracts features from a temporal stack
of consecutive Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI) magnetogram images to produce a flaring probability. The
probability of flaring is added to a feature vector derived from the
magnetograms to train an extremely randomized trees (ERT) model in the second
stage to produce a binary deterministic prediction (flare/no flare) in a
12-hour forecast window. To tune the hyperparameters of the architecture a new
evaluation metric is introduced, the ""scaled True Skill Statistic"". It
specifically addresses the large discrepancy between the true positive rate and
the false positive rate in the highly unbalanced solar flare event training
datasets. Through hyperparameter tuning to maximize this new metric, our
two-stage architecture drastically reduces false positives by $\approx$ $48\%$
without significantly affecting the true positives (reduction by $\approx$
$12\%$), when compared with predictions from the first stage CNN alone. This,
in turn, improves various traditional binary classification metrics sensitive
to false positives such as the precision, F1 and the Heidke Skill Score. The
end result is a more robust 12-hour flare prediction system that could be
combined with current operational flare forecasting methods. Additionally,
using the ERT-based feature ranking mechanism, we show that the CNN output
probability is highly ranked in terms of flare prediction relevance.",2021-11-21T00:32:19Z
A catalogue of 323 cataclysmic variables from LAMOST DR6,"In this work, we present a catalog of cataclysmic variables (CVs) identified
from the Sixth Data Release (DR6) of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber
Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). To single out the CV spectra, we introduce a
novel machine-learning algorithm called UMAP to screen out a total of 169,509
H$\alpha$-emission spectra, and obtain a classification accuracy of the
algorithm of over 99.6$\%$ from the cross-validation set. We then apply the
template matching program PyHammer v2.0 to the LAMOST spectra to obtain the
optimal spectral type with metallicity, which helps us identify the
chromospherically active stars and potential binary stars from the 169,509
spectra. After visually inspecting all the spectra, we identify 323 CV
candidates from the LAMOST database, among them 52 objects are new. We further
discuss the new CV candidates in subtypes based on their spectral features,
including five DN subtype during outbursts, five NL subtype and four magnetic
CVs (three AM Her type and one IP type). We also find two CVs that have been
previously identified by photometry, and confirm their previous classification
by the LAMOST spectra.",2021-11-25T12:16:44Z
"Catching a grown-up starfish planetary nebula II. Plasma analysis and
  central star properties of PC 22","After performing the morpho-kinematic analysis of the planetary nebula (PN)
PC 22, we now present its nebular and stellar analysis. The plasma
investigation relies on the novel use of a Monte Carlo analysis associated to
the PyNeb code for the uncertainty propagation. The innermost region of the
nebula shows electronic temperatures $T_{\rm e}$ $\approx$ 10,800~K using [NII]
and $\approx$ 13,000 K using [OIII] and electronic densities $n_{\rm e}$
$\approx$ 600~cm$^{-3}$. We also used for the first time a Machine Learning
Algorithm to calculate Ionisation Correction Factors (ICFs) specifically
adapted to PC 22. This has allowed us to have pioneer ICFs for (S$^{+}$ +
S$^{++}$)/O$^{++}$, Cl$^{++}$/O$^{++}$, and Ar$^{3+}$+Ar$^{4+}$, as well as a
possible new determination for the total abundance of neon. The study of the
stellar spectrum revealed the presence of broad emission lines consistent with
a Wolf-Rayet-type [WR] classification and more precisely a [WO1]-subtype based
on different qualitative and quantitative criteria. This classification is also
coherent with the high stellar temperature derived from the reproduction of the
ionization state of the gas with the Mexican Million Models database (3MdB) and
the best fit model obtained with the NLTE model atmosphere code PoWR. PC 22 is
therefore a new addition to the [WO1]-subtype PNe.",2021-12-17T17:53:28Z
"Discovery of 16 New Members of the Solar Neighborhood using Proper
  Motions from CatWISE2020","In an effort to identify nearby and unusual cold objects in the solar
neighborhood, we searched for previously unidentified moving objects using
CatWISE2020 proper motion data combined with machine learning methods. We
paired the motion candidates with their counterparts in 2MASS, UHS, and VHS.
Then we searched for white dwarf, brown dwarf, and subdwarf outliers on the
resulting color-color diagrams. This resulted in the discovery of 16 new dwarfs
including two nearby M dwarfs (< 30 pc), a possible young L dwarf, a high
motion early T dwarf and 3 later T dwarfs. This research represents a step
forward in completing the census of the Sun's neighbors.",2021-12-17T00:13:53Z
"97 Eclipsing Quadruple Star Candidates Discovered in TESS Full Frame
  Images","We present a catalog of 97 uniformly-vetted candidates for quadruple star
systems. The candidates were identified in TESS Full Frame Image data from
Sectors 1 through 42 through a combination of machine learning techniques and
visual examination, with major contributions from a dedicated group of citizen
scientists. All targets exhibit two sets of eclipses with two different
periods, both of which pass photocenter tests confirming that the eclipses are
on-target. This catalog outlines the statistical properties of the sample,
nearly doubles the number of known multiply-eclipsing quadruple systems, and
provides the basis for detailed future studies of individual systems. Several
important discoveries have already resulted from this effort, including the
first sextuply-eclipsing sextuple stellar system and the first transiting
circumbinary planet detected from one sector of TESS data.",2022-02-11T17:35:32Z
"The VVV Open Cluster Project II. Near-infrared sequences of 37 open
  clusters on eight-dimensional parameter space","Open clusters are key coeval structures that help us understand star
formation, stellar evolution and trace the physical properties of our Galaxy.
In the past years, the isolation of open clusters from the field has been
heavily alleviated by the access to accurate large-scale stellar parallaxes and
proper motions along a determined line of sight. Still, there are limitations
regarding their completeness since large-scale studies rely on optical
wavelengths. Here we extend the open clusters sequences towards fainter
magnitudes complementing the Gaia photometric and astrometric information with
near-infrared data from the VVV survey. We performed a homogeneous analysis on
37 open clusters implementing two coarse-to-fine characterization methods:
extreme deconvolution Gaussian mixture models coupled with an unsupervised
machine learning method on 8-dimensional parameter space. The process allowed
us to separate the clusters from the field at near-infrared wavelengths. We
report an increase of $\sim$47\% new member candidates on average in our sample
(considering only sources with high membership probability p$\geqq$0.9). This
study is the second in a series intended to reveal open cluster near-infrared
sequences homogeneously.",2022-05-05T16:15:40Z
"Classifying Kepler light curves for 12,000 A and F stars using
  supervised feature-based machine learning","With the availability of large-scale surveys like Kepler and TESS, there is a
pressing need for automated methods to classify light curves according to known
classes of variable stars. We introduce a new algorithm for classifying light
curves that compares 7000 time-series features to find those which most
effectively classify a given set of light curves. We apply our method to Kepler
light curves for stars with effective temperatures in the range 6500--10,000K.
We show that the sample can be meaningfully represented in an interpretable
five-dimensional feature space that separates seven major classes of light
curves (delta Scuti stars, gamma Doradus stars, RR Lyrae stars, rotational
variables, contact eclipsing binaries, detached eclipsing binaries, and
non-variables). We achieve a balanced classification accuracy of 82% on an
independent test set of Kepler stars using a Gaussian mixture model classifier.
We use our method to classify 12,000 Kepler light curves from Quarter 9 and
provide a catalogue of the results. We further outline a confidence heuristic
based on probability density with which to search our catalogue, and extract
candidate lists of correctly-classified variable stars.",2022-05-06T05:31:18Z
Estimating accurate reddening values of LAMOST M dwarfs,"M dwarfs are the dominating type of stars in the solar neighbourhood. They
serve as excellent tracers for the study of the distribution and properties of
the nearby interstellar dust. In this work, we aim to obtain high accuracy
reddening values of M dwarf stars from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber
Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) Data Release 8 (DR8). Combining the LAMOST
spectra with the high-quality optical photometry from the Gaia Early Data
Release 3 (Gaia EDR3), we have estimated the reddening values $E(G_{\rm
BP}-G_{\rm RP})$ of 641,426 M dwarfs with the machine-learning algorithm Random
Forest regression. The typical reddening uncertainty is only 0.03 mag in
$E(G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP})$. We have obtained the reddening coefficient
$R_{(G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP})}$, which is a function of the stellar intrinsic
colour $(G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP})_0$ and reddening value $E(B-V)$. The values of
$E(B-V)$ are also provided for the individual stars in our catalogue. Our
resultant high accuracy reddening values of M dwarfs, combined with the Gaia
parallaxes, will be very powerful to map the fine structures of the dust in the
solar neighbourhood.",2022-06-08T01:30:11Z
"Multiscale entropy analysis of astronomical time series. Discovering
  subclusters of hybrid pulsators","The multiscale entropy assesses the complexity of a signal across different
timescales. It originates from the biomedical domain and was recently
successfully used to characterize light curves as part of a supervised machine
learning framework to classify stellar variability. We explore the behavior of
the multiscale entropy in detail by studying its algorithmic properties in a
stellar variability context and by linking it with traditional astronomical
time series analysis methods. We subsequently use the multiscale entropy as the
basis for an interpretable clustering framework that can distinguish hybrid
pulsators with both p- and g-modes from stars with only p-mode pulsations, such
as $\delta$ Sct stars, or from stars with only g-mode pulsations, such as
$\gamma$ Dor stars. We find that the multiscale entropy is a powerful tool for
capturing variability patterns in stellar light curves. The multiscale entropy
provides insights into the pulsation structure of a star and reveals how short-
and long-term variability interact with each other based on time-domain
information only. We also show that the multiscale entropy is correlated to the
frequency content of a stellar signal and in particular to the near-core
rotation rates of g-mode pulsators. We find that our new clustering framework
can successfully identify the hybrid pulsators with both p- and g-modes in sets
of $\delta$ Sct and $\gamma$ Dor stars, respectively. The benefit of our
clustering framework is that it is unsupervised. It therefore does not require
previously labeled data and hence is not biased by previous knowledge.",2022-06-27T18:00:01Z
UOCS-VIII. UV Study of the open cluster NGC 2506 using ASTROSAT,"We study an intermediate-age open cluster NGC 2506 using the
\textit{ASTROSAT}/UVIT data and other archival data. We identified 2175 cluster
members using a machine learning-based algorithm, ML--MOC, on Gaia EDR3 data.
Among the cluster members detected in UVIT filters, F148W, F154W, and F169M, we
detect 9 blue straggler stars (BSS), 3 yellow straggler stars (YSS) and 3 red
clump (RC) stars. We construct multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of these objects to characterize them and to estimate their parameters.
We discovered hot companions to 3 BSS, 2 YSS and 3 RC candidates and estimated
their properties. The hot companions with estimated temperatures,
T$\mathrm{_{eff}}$ $\sim$ 13250--31000 K, are WDs of extremely low-mass ($\sim$
0.20 M$_\odot$), low-mass ($\sim$ 0.20--0.40 M$_\odot$), normal mass ($\sim$
0.40--0.60 M$_\odot$), and high-mass ($\sim$ 0.8 M$_\odot$). We suggest that
systems with extremely low mass and low mass WDs as companions are formed via
Case-A/Case-B mass transfer mechanism. A BSS is the likely progenitor of the
high mass WD, as a star with more than the turn-off mass of the cluster is
needed to form a high mass WD. Thus, systems with high mass WD are likely to be
formed through merger in triple systems. We conclude that mass transfer as well
as merger pathways of BSS formation are present in this cluster.",2022-09-02T08:40:41Z
"Unveiling hidden stellar aggregates in the Milky Way: 1656 new star
  clusters found in Gaia EDR3","We report 1,656 new star clusters found in the Galactic disk (|b|<20 degrees)
beyond 1.2 kpc, using Gaia EDR3 data. Based on an unsupervised machine learning
algorithm, DBSCAN, and followed our previous studies, we utilized a unique
method to do the data preparation and obtained the clustering coefficients,
which proved to be an effective way to search blindly for star clusters. We
tabulated the physical parameters and member stars of the new clusters, and
presented some interesting examples, including a globular cluster candidate.
The cluster parameters and member stars are available at CDS via anonymous ftp
to https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/ftp/vizier.submit//he22c. We examined the new
discoveries and discussed their statistical properties. The proper motion
dispersions and radii of the new clusters were the same as the previously
reported ones. The new star clusters beyond 1.2 kpc were older than those in
the solar neighborhood, and the new objects found in the third Galactic
quadrant presented the lowest line-of-sight extinctions. Combined with our
previous results, the total population of new clusters detected through our
method was 2,541, corresponding to 55% of all newly published clusters in the
Gaia era. The number of cataloged Gaia star clusters was also increased to
nearly six thousand. In the near future, it is necessary to make a unified
confirmation and member star determination for all reported clusters.",2022-09-18T08:24:38Z
"Spectroscopic follow-up of statistically selected extremely metal-poor
  star candidates from GALAH DR3","The advent of large-scale stellar spectroscopic surveys naturally leads to
the implementation of machine learning techniques to isolate, for example,
small sub-samples of potentially interesting stars from the full data set. A
recent example is the application of the t-SNE statistical method to
$\sim$600,000 stellar spectra from the GALAH survey in order to identify a
sample of candidate extremely metal-poor (EMP, [Fe/H] $\leq$ -3) stars. We
report the outcome of low-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of 83 GALAH EMP
candidates that lack any previous metallicity estimates. Overall, the
statistical selection is found to be efficient ($\sim$one-third of the
candidates have [Fe/H] $\leq$ -2.75) with low contamination ($<$10% have [Fe/H]
$>$ -2), and with a metallicity distribution function that is consistent with
previous work. Five stars are found to have [Fe/H] $\leq$ -3.0, one of which is
a main sequence turnoff star. Two other stars are revealed as likely
carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars of type CEMP-$s$, and a known carbon
star is re-identified. The results indicate that the statistical selection
approach employed was successful, and therefore it can be applied to
forthcoming even larger stellar spectroscopic surveys with the expectation of
similar positive outcomes.",2022-10-11T05:43:44Z
"SuNeRF: Validation of a 3D Global Reconstruction of the Solar Corona
  Using Simulated EUV Images","Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) light emitted by the Sun impacts satellite
operations and communications and affects the habitability of planets.
Currently, EUV-observing instruments are constrained to viewing the Sun from
its equator (i.e., ecliptic), limiting our ability to forecast EUV emission for
other viewpoints (e.g. solar poles), and to generalize our knowledge of the
Sun-Earth system to other host stars. In this work, we adapt Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRFs) to the physical properties of the Sun and demonstrate that
non-ecliptic viewpoints could be reconstructed from observations limited to the
solar ecliptic. To validate our approach, we train on simulations of solar EUV
emission that provide a ground truth for all viewpoints. Our model accurately
reconstructs the simulated 3D structure of the Sun, achieving a peak
signal-to-noise ratio of 43.3 dB and a mean absolute relative error of 0.3\%
for non-ecliptic viewpoints. Our method provides a consistent 3D reconstruction
of the Sun from a limited number of viewpoints, thus highlighting the potential
to create a virtual instrument for satellite observations of the Sun. Its
extension to real observations will provide the missing link to compare the Sun
to other stars and to improve space-weather forecasting.",2022-11-27T16:30:26Z
"Identifying preflare spectral features using explainable artificial
  intelligence","The prediction of solar flares is of practical and scientific interest;
however, many machine learning methods used for this prediction task do not
provide the physical explanations behind a model's performance. We made use of
two recently developed explainable artificial intelligence techniques called
gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) and expected gradients
(EG) to reveal the decision-making process behind a high-performance neural
network that has been trained to distinguish between MgII spectra derived from
flaring and nonflaring active regions, a fact that can be applied to the task
of short timescale flare forecasting. The two techniques generate visual
explanations (heatmaps) that can be projected back onto the spectra, allowing
for the identification of features that are strongly associated with precursory
flare activity. We automated the search for explainable interpretations on the
level of individual wavelengths, and provide multiple examples of flare
prediction using IRIS spectral data, finding that prediction scores in general
increase before flare onset. Large IRIS rasters that cover a significant
portion of the active region and coincide with small preflare brightenings both
in IRIS and SDO/AIA images tend to lead to better forecasts. The models reveal
that MgII triplet emission, flows, as well as broad and highly asymmetric
spectra are all important for the task of flare prediction. Additionally, we
find that intensity is only weakly correlated to a spectrum's prediction score,
meaning that low intensity spectra can still be of great importance for the
flare prediction task, and that $78$% of the time, the position of the model's
maximum attention along the slit during the preflare phase is predictive of the
location of the flare's maximum UV emission",2023-01-04T12:02:03Z
"Towards a population synthesis of discs and planets. II. Confronting
  disc models and observations at the population level","Aims. We want to find the distribution of initial conditions that best
reproduces disc observations at the population level. Methods. We first ran a
parameter study using a 1D model that includes the viscous evolution of a gas
disc, dust, and pebbles, coupled with an emission model to compute the
millimetre flux observable with ALMA. This was used to train a machine learning
surrogate model that can compute the relevant quantity for comparison with
observations in seconds. This surrogate model was used to perform parameter
studies and synthetic disc populations. Results. Performing a parameter study,
we find that internal photoevaporation leads to a lower dependency of disc
lifetime on stellar mass than external photoevaporation. This dependence should
be investigated in the future. Performing population synthesis, we find that
under the combined losses of internal and external photoevaporation, discs are
too short lived. Conclusions. To match observational constraints, future models
of disc evolution need to include one or a combination of the following
processes: infall of material to replenish the discs, shielding of the disc
from internal photoevaporation due to magnetically driven disc winds, and
extinction of external high-energy radiation. Nevertheless, disc properties in
low-external-photoevaporation regions can be reproduced by having more massive
and compact discs. Here, the optimum values of the $\alpha$ viscosity parameter
lie between $3\times10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$ and with internal photoevaporation
being the main mode of disc dispersal.",2023-01-11T19:00:00Z
"Climbing the Cliffs: Classifying YSOs in the Cosmic Cliffs JWST Data
  using a Probabilistic Random Forest","Among the first observations released to the public from the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) was a section of the star-forming region NGC 3324 known
colloquially as the ""Cosmic Cliffs."" We build a photometric catalog of the
region and test the ability of using the Probabilistic Random Forest machine
learning method to identify its Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). We find 450
candidate YSOs (cYSOs) out of 19~497 total objects within the field, 413 of
which are cYSOs not found in previous works. These classifications are verified
with several different metrics, including recall and precision. Using the
obtained probabilities of objects being YSOs, we employ a Monte Carlo approach
to determine the surface density of cYSOs in the Cosmic Cliffs, which we find
to be largely coincident with column densities derived from Herschel data, up
to a column density of 1.37 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. The newly determined
number and spatial distribution of YSOs in the Cosmic Cliffs demonstrate that
JWST is far more capable of detecting YSOs in dusty regions than Spitzer.
Comparisons of the observed colors and brightness of faint cYSOs with those of
pre-main-sequence models suggest JWST has detected a significant population of

"S-type stars from LAMOST DR10: classification of intrinsic and extrinsic
  stars","In this paper, we found 2939 S-type stars from LAMOST Data Release 10 using
two machine-learning methods, and 2306 of them were reported for the first
time. The main purpose of this work is to study how to divide S-type stars into
intrinsic and extrinsic stars with photometric data and LAMOST spectra. Using
infrared photometric data, we adopted two methods to distinguish S-type stars,
i.e., XGBoost algorithm and color-color diagrams. We trained XGBoost model with
15 input features consisting of colors and absolute magnitudes of Two Micron
All Sky Survey (2MASS), AllWISE, AKARI, and IRAS, and found that the model
trained by input features with 2MASS, AKARI, and IRAS data has the highest
accuracy of 95.52%. Furthermore, using this XGBoost model, we found four
color-color diagrams with six infrared color criteria to divide S-type stars,
which has an accuracy of about 90%. Applying the two methods to the 2939 S-type
stars, 381 (XGBoost)/336 (color-color diagrams) intrinsic and 495 (XGBoost)/82
(color-color diagrams) extrinsic stars were classified, respectively. Using
these photometrically classified intrinsic and extrinsic stars, we retrained
XGBoost model with their blue and red medium-resolution spectra, and the 2939
stars were divided into 855 intrinsic and 2056 extrinsic stars from spectra
with an accuracy of 94.82%. In addition, we also found four spectral regions of
Zr I (6451.6A), Ne II (6539.6A), H{\alpha} (6564.5A), and Fe I (6609.1A) and C
I (6611.4A) are the most important features, which can reach an accuracy of
92.1% when using them to classify S-type stars.",2023-05-16T09:03:37Z
"StarUnLink: identifying and mitigating signals from communications
  satellites in stellar spectral surveys","A relatively new concern for the forthcoming massive spectroscopic sky
surveys is the impact of contamination from low earth orbit satellites. Several
hundred thousand of these satellites are licensed for launch in the next few
years and it has been estimated that, in some cases, up to a few percent of
spectra could be contaminated when using wide field, multi-fiber spectrographs.
In this paper, a multi-staged approach is used to assess the practicality and
limitations of identifying and minimizing the impact of satellite contamination
in a WEAVE-like stellar spectral survey. We develop a series of
convolutional-network based architectures to attempt identification, stellar
parameter and chemical abundances recovery, and source separation of stellar
spectra that we artificially contaminate with satellite (i.e. solar-like)
spectra. Our results show that we are able to flag 67% of all contaminated
sources at a precision level of 80% for low-resolution spectra and 96% for
high-resolution spectra. Additionally, we are able to remove the contamination
from the spectra and recover the clean spectra with a $<$1% reconstruction
error. The errors in stellar parameter predictions reduce by up to a factor of
2-3 when either including contamination as an augmentation to a training set or
by removing the contamination from the spectra, with overall better performance
in the former case. The presented methods illustrate several machine learning
mitigation strategies that can be implemented to improve stellar parameters for
contaminated spectra in the WEAVE stellar spectroscopic survey and others like
it.",2023-06-28T18:15:32Z
KilonovAE: Exploring Kilonova Spectral Features with Autoencoders,"Kilonovae are likely a key site of heavy r-process element production in the
Universe, and their optical/infrared spectra contain insights into both the
properties of the ejecta and the conditions of the r-process. However, the
event GW170817/AT2017gfo is the only kilonova so far with well-observed
spectra. To understand the diversity of absorption features that might be
observed in future kilonovae spectra, we use the TARDIS Monte Carlo radiative
transfer code to simulate a suite of optical spectra spanning a wide range of
kilonova ejecta properties and r-process abundance patterns. To identify the
most common and prominent absorption lines, we perform dimensionality reduction
using an autoencoder, and we find spectra clusters in the latent space
representation using a Bayesian Gaussian Mixture model. Our synthetic kilonovae
spectra commonly display strong absorption by strontium Sr II, yttrium Y II,
and zirconium Zr I - II, with strong lanthanide contributions at low electron
fractions (Ye < 0.25). When a new kilonova is observed, our machine learning
framework will provide context on the dominant absorption lines and key ejecta
properties, helping to determine where this event falls within the larger 'zoo'
of kilonovae spectra.",2023-08-29T22:27:08Z
Semantic Segmentation of Solar Radio Spikes at Low Frequencies,"Solar radio spikes are short lived, narrow bandwidth features in low
frequency solar radio observations. The timing of their occurrence and the
number of spikes in a given observation is often unpredictable. The high
temporal and frequency of resolution of modern radio telescopes such as NenuFAR
mean that manually identifying radio spikes is an arduous task. Machine
learning approaches to data exploration in solar radio data is on the rise.
Here we describe a convolutional neural network to identify the per pixel
location of radio spikes as well as determine some simple characteristics of
duration, spectral width and drift rate. The model, which we call SpikeNet, was
trained using an Nvidia Tesla T4 16GB GPU with ~100000 sample spikes in a total
time of 2.2 hours. The segmentation performs well with an intersection over
union in the test set of ~0.85. The root mean squared error for predicted spike
properties is of the order of 23%. Applying the algorithm to unlabelled data
successfully generates segmentation masks although the accuracy of the
predicted properties is less reliable, particularly when more than one spike is
present in the same 64 X 64 pixel time-frequency range. We have successfully
demonstrated that our convolutional neural network can locate and characterise
solar radio spikes in a number of seconds compared to the weeks it would take
for manual identification.",2024-03-13T13:59:40Z
"Constraining Protoplanetary Disk Winds from Forbidden Line Profiles with
  Simulation-based Inference","Protoplanetary disks are the sites of vigorous hydrodynamic processes, such
as accretion and outflows, and ultimately establish the conditions for the
formation of planets. The properties of disk outflows are often inferred
through analysis of forbidden emission lines. These lines contain multiple
overlapping components, tracing different emission regions with different
processes that excite them: a high-velocity component (tracing a jet), a broad
low-velocity component (tracing inner disk wind), and a narrow low-velocity
component (tracing outer disk wind). They are also heavily contaminated by
background spectral features. All of these challenges call into question the
traditional approach of fitting Gaussian components to the line profiles, and
cloud the physical interpretation of those components. We introduce a novel
statistical technique to analyze emission lines in protoplanetary disks.
Simulation-Based Inference is a computationally efficient machine learning
technique that produces posterior distributions of the parameters (e.g.
magnetic field, radiation sources, geometry) of a representative wind model
when given a spectrum, without any prior assumption about line shapes
(e.g.symmetry). In this pathfinder study, we demonstrate that this technique
indeed accurately recovers the parameters from simulated spectra without noise
and background. A following work will deal with the analysis of observed
spectra.",2024-03-15T12:27:01Z
"Quantitative modelling of type Ia supernovae spectral time series:
  Constraining the explosion physics","Multiple explosion mechanisms have been proposed to explain type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia). Empirical modelling tools have also been developed that
allow for fast, customised modelling of individual SNe and direct comparisons
between observations and explosion model predictions. Such tools have provided
useful insights, but the subjective nature with which empirical modelling is
performed makes it difficult to obtain robust constraints on the explosion
physics or expand studies to large populations of objects. Machine learning
accelerated tools have therefore begun to gain traction. In this paper, we
present riddler, a framework for automated fitting of SNe Ia spectral sequences
up to shortly after maximum light. We train a series of neural networks on
realistic ejecta profiles predicted by the W7 and N100 explosion models to
emulate full radiative transfer simulations and apply nested sampling to
determine the best-fitting model parameters for multiple spectra of a given SN
simultaneously. We show that riddler is able to accurately recover the
parameters of input spectra and use it to fit observations of two well-studied
SNe Ia. We also investigate the impact of different weighting schemes when
performing quantitative spectral fitting and show that best-fitting models and
parameters are highly dependent on the assumed weighting schemes and priors. As
spectroscopic samples of SNe Ia continue to grow, automated spectral fitting
tools such as riddler will become increasingly important to maximise the
physical constraints that can be gained in a quantitative and consistent
manner.",2024-03-25T15:58:06Z
"Super-Resolution of SOHO/MDI Magnetograms of Solar Active Regions Using
  SDO/HMI Data and an Attention-Aided Convolutional Neural Network","Image super-resolution has been an important subject in image processing and
recognition. Here, we present an attention-aided convolutional neural network
(CNN) for solar image super-resolution. Our method, named SolarCNN, aims to
enhance the quality of line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms of solar active regions
(ARs) collected by the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The ground-truth labels used for training
SolarCNN are the LOS magnetograms collected by the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Solar ARs consist
of strong magnetic fields in which magnetic energy can suddenly be released to
produce extreme space weather events, such as solar flares, coronal mass
ejections, and solar energetic particles. SOHO/MDI covers Solar Cycle 23, which
is stronger with more eruptive events than Cycle 24. Enhanced SOHO/MDI
magnetograms allow for better understanding and forecasting of violent events
of space weather. Experimental results show that SolarCNN improves the quality
of SOHO/MDI magnetograms in terms of the structural similarity index measure
(SSIM), Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC), and the peak signal-to-noise
ratio (PSNR).",2024-03-27T06:58:01Z
"Metallicity of RR Lyrae stars from the Gaia Data Release 3 catalogue
  computed with Machine Learning algorithms","We present new $P -\phi_{31}-{\rm [Fe/H]}$ and $P -\phi_{31}- A_2 - {\rm
[Fe/H]}$ relations for fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone mode (RRc) RR
Lyrae stars (RRLs), respectively. The relations were calibrated based on
pulsation periods and Fourier parameters of the RRL light curves in the Gaia
$G$-band published in the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), and accurate
spectroscopically measured metallicities available in the literature. We apply
the feature selection algorithm to identify the most relevant parameters for
the determination of metallicity. To fit the relations, we used the Bayesian
approach, which allowed us to carefully take into account uncertainties in
various parameters and the intrinsic scatter of the relations. The root mean
squared errors of the predicted metallicity values in the training samples are
0.28 dex and 0.21 dex for RRab and RRc stars, respectively, comparable with the
typical uncertainty of low/intermediate resolution spectroscopic metallicity
measurements. We applied the new relations to measure individual metallicities
and distances to $\sim$ 134,000 RRLs from the Gaia DR3 catalogue, as well as
mean metallicities and distances to 38 Milky Way globular clusters. We also
estimate the mean metallicity and distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)
and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC): ${\rm [Fe/H]_{LMC} = -1.63\pm0.36}$ and
$\mu_{\rm LMC}=18.55\pm0.18$~mag, ${\rm [Fe/H]_{SMC}=-1.86\pm0.36}$~dex and
$\mu_{\rm SMC}=19.01\pm 0.17$~mag, respectively, in excellent agreement with
previous measurements.",2024-07-08T10:51:41Z
"The K2 Galactic Archaeology Program Data Release 3: Age-abundance
  patterns in C1-C8 and C10-C18","We present the third and final data release of the K2 Galactic Archaeology
Program (K2 GAP) for Campaigns C1-C8 and C10-C18. We provide asteroseismic
radius and mass coefficients, $\kappa_R$ and $\kappa_M$, for $\sim 19,000$ red
giant stars, which translate directly to radius and mass given a temperature.
As such, K2 GAP DR3 represents the largest asteroseismic sample in the
literature to date. K2 GAP DR3 stellar parameters are calibrated to be on an
absolute parallactic scale based on Gaia DR2, with red giant branch and red
clump evolutionary state classifications provided via a machine-learning
approach. Combining these stellar parameters with GALAH DR3 spectroscopy, we
determine asteroseismic ages with precisions of $\sim 20-30\%$ and compare
age-abundance relations to Galactic chemical evolution models among both low-
and high-$\alpha$ populations for $\alpha$, light, iron-peak, and
neutron-capture elements. We confirm recent indications in the literature of
both increased Ba production at late Galactic times, as well as significant
contribution to r-process enrichment from prompt sources associated with, e.g.,
core-collapse supernovae. With an eye toward other Galactic archaeology
applications, we characterize K2 GAP DR3 uncertainties and completeness using
injection tests, suggesting K2 GAP DR3 is largely unbiased in mass/age and with
uncertainties of $2.9\%\,(\rm{stat.})\,\pm0.1\%\,(\rm{syst.})$ &
$6.7\%\,(\rm{stat.})\,\pm0.3\%\,(\rm{syst.})$ in $\kappa_R$ & $\kappa_M$ for
red giant branch stars and $4.7\%\,(\rm{stat.})\,\pm0.3\%\,(\rm{syst.})$ &
$11\%\,(\rm{stat.})\,\pm0.9\%\,(\rm{syst.})$ for red clump stars. We also
identify percent-level asteroseismic systematics, which are likely related to
the time baseline of the underlying data, and which therefore should be
considered in TESS asteroseismic analysis.",2021-08-11T21:35:47Z
The EPOCH Project: I. Periodic variable stars in the EROS-2 LMC database,"The EPOCH (EROS-2 periodic variable star classification using machine
learning) project aims to detect periodic variable stars in the EROS-2 light
curve database. In this paper, we present the first result of the
classification of periodic variable stars in the EROS-2 LMC database. To
classify these variables, we first built a training set by compiling known
variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud area from the OGLE and MACHO surveys.
We crossmatched these variables with the EROS-2 sources and extracted 22
variability features from 28 392 light curves of the corresponding EROS-2
sources. We then used the random forest method to classify the EROS-2 sources
in the training set. We designed the model to separate not only $\delta$ Scuti
stars, RR Lyraes, Cepheids, eclipsing binaries, and long-period variables, the
superclasses, but also their subclasses, such as RRab, RRc, RRd, and RRe for RR
Lyraes, and similarly for the other variable types. The model trained using
only the superclasses shows 99% recall and precision, while the model trained
on all subclasses shows 87% recall and precision. We applied the trained model
to the entire EROS-2 LMC database, which contains about 29 million sources, and
found 117 234 periodic variable candidates. Out of these 117 234 periodic
variables, 55 285 have not been discovered by either OGLE or MACHO variability
studies. This set comprises 1 906 $\delta$ Scuti stars, 6 607 RR Lyraes, 638
Cepheids, 178 Type II Cepheids, 34 562 eclipsing binaries, and 11 394
long-period variables. A catalog of these EROS-2 LMC periodic variable stars
will be available online at http://stardb.yonsei.ac.kr and at the CDS website
(http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR).",2014-03-24T20:04:10Z
A Package for the Automated Classification of Periodic Variable Stars,"We present a machine learning package for the classification of periodic
variable stars. Our package is intended to be general: it can classify any
single band optical light curve comprising at least a few tens of observations
covering durations from weeks to years, with arbitrary time sampling. We use
light curves of periodic variable stars taken from OGLE and EROS-2 to train the
model. To make our classifier relatively survey-independent, it is trained on
16 features extracted from the light curves (e.g. period, skewness, Fourier
amplitude ratio). The model classifies light curves into one of seven
superclasses - Delta Scuti, RR Lyrae, Cepheid, Type II Cepheid, eclipsing
binary, long-period variable, non-variable - as well as subclasses of these,
such as ab, c, d, and e types for RR Lyraes. When trained to give only
superclasses, our model achieves 0.98 for both recall and precision as measured
on an independent validation dataset (on a scale of 0 to 1). When trained to
give subclasses, it achieves 0.81 for both recall and precision. In order to
assess classification performance of the subclass model, we applied it to the
MACHO, LINEAR, and ASAS periodic variables, which gave recall/precision of
0.92/0.98, 0.89/0.96, and 0.84/0.88, respectively. We also applied the subclass
model to Hipparcos periodic variable stars of many other variability types that
do not exist in our training set, in order to examine how much those types
degrade the classification performance of our target classes. In addition, we
investigate how the performance varies with the number of data points and
duration of observations. We find that recall and precision do not vary
significantly if the number of data points is larger than 80 and the duration
is more than a few weeks. The classifier software of the subclass model is
available from the GitHub repository (https://goo.gl/xmFO6Q).",2015-12-05T02:23:45Z
"An artificial neural network to discover Hypervelocity stars: Candidates
  in Gaia DR1/TGAS","The paucity of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) known to date has severely hampered
their potential to investigate the stellar population of the Galactic Centre
and the Galactic Potential. The first Gaia data release gives an opportunity to
increase the current sample. The challenge is the disparity between the
expected number of hypervelocity stars and that of bound background stars. We
have applied a novel data mining algorithm based on machine learning
techniques, an artificial neural network, to the Tycho-Gaia astrometric
solution (TGAS) catalogue. With no pre-selection of data, we could exclude
immediately $\sim 99 \%$ of the stars in the catalogue and find 80 candidates
with more than $90\%$ predicted probability to be HVSs, based only on their
position, proper motions, and parallax. We have cross-checked our findings with
other spectroscopic surveys, determining radial velocities for 30 and
spectroscopic distances for 5 candidates. In addition, follow-up observations
have been carried out at the Isaac Newton Telescope for 22 stars, for which we
obtained radial velocities and distance estimates. We discover 14 stars with a
total velocity in the Galactic rest frame > 400 km/s, and 5 of these have a
probability $>50\%$ of being unbound from the Milky Way. Tracing back their
orbits in different Galactic potential models we find one possible unbound HVS
with velocity $\sim$ 520 km/s, 5 bound HVSs, and, notably, 5 runaway stars with
median velocity between 400 and 780 km/s. At the moment, uncertainties in the
distance estimates and ages are too large to confirm the nature of our
candidates by narrowing down their ejection location, and we wait for future
Gaia releases to validate the quality of our sample. This test successfully
demonstrates the feasibility of our new data mining routine.",2017-04-26T07:12:24Z
Modelling the structure of star clusters with fractional Brownian motion,"The degree of fractal substructure in molecular clouds can be quantified by
comparing them with Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM) surfaces or volumes. These
fields are self-similar over all length scales and characterised by a drift
exponent $H$, which describes the structural roughness. Given that the
structure of molecular clouds and the initial structure of star clusters are
almost certainly linked, it would be advantageous to also apply this analysis
to clusters. Currently, the structure of star clusters is often quantified by
applying $\mathcal{Q}$ analysis. $\mathcal{Q}$ values from observed targets are
interpreted by comparing them with those from artificial clusters. These are
typically generated using a Box-Fractal (BF) or Radial Density Profile (RDP)
model. We present a single cluster model, based on FBM, as an alternative to
these models. Here, the structure is parameterised by $H$, and the standard
deviation of the log-surface/volume density $\sigma$. The FBM model is able to
reproduce both centrally concentrated and substructured clusters, and is able
to provide a much better match to observations than the BF model. We show that
$\mathcal{Q}$ analysis is unable to estimate FBM parameters. Therefore, we
develop and train a machine learning algorithm which can estimate values of $H$
and $\sigma$, with uncertainties. This provides us with a powerful method for
quantifying the structure of star clusters in terms which relate to the
structure of molecular clouds. We use the algorithm to estimate the $H$ and
$\sigma$ for several young star clusters, some of which have no measurable BF
or RDP analogue.",2018-04-18T16:36:03Z
"Ages and Masses of 0.64 million Red Giant Branch stars from the LAMOST
  Galactic Spectroscopic Survey","We present a catalog of stellar age and mass estimates for a sample of
640\,986 red giant branch (RGB) stars of the Galactic disk from the LAMOST
Galactic Spectroscopic Survey (DR4). The RGB stars are distinguished from the
red clump stars utilizing period spacing derived from the spectra with a
machine learning method based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA).
Cross-validation suggests our method is capable of distinguishing RC from RGB
stars with only 2 per cent contamination rate for stars with signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) higher than 50. The age and mass of these RGB stars are determined
from their LAMOST spectra with KPCA method by taking the LAMOST - $Kepler$
giant stars having asteroseismic parameters and the LAMOST-TGAS sub-giant stars
based on isochrones as training sets. Examinations suggest that the age and
mass estimates of our RGB sample stars with SNR $>$ 30 have a median error of
30 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively. Stellar ages are found to exhibit
positive vertical and negative radial gradients across the disk, and the age
structure of the disk is strongly flared across the whole disk of
$6<R<13$\,kpc. The data set demonstrates good correlations among stellar age,
[Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe]. There are two separate sequences in the [Fe/H] --
[$\alpha$/Fe] plane: a high--$\alpha$ sequence with stars older than
$\sim$\,8\,Gyr and a low--$\alpha$ sequence composed of stars with ages
covering the whole range of possible ages of stars. We also examine relations
between age and kinematic parameters derived from the Gaia DR2 parallax and
proper motions. Both the median value and dispersion of the orbital
eccentricity are found to increase with age. The vertical angular momentum is
found to fairly smoothly decrease with age from 2 to 12\,Gyr, with a rate of
about $-$50\,kpc\,km\,s$^{-1}$\,Gyr$^{-1}$. A full table of the catalog is
public available online.",2019-01-22T10:02:54Z
"Supernova Photometric Classification Pipelines Trained on
  Spectroscopically Classified Supernovae from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium-Deep
  Survey","Photometric classification of supernovae (SNe) is imperative as recent and
upcoming optical time-domain surveys, such as the Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope (LSST), overwhelm the available resources for spectrosopic follow-up.
Here we develop a range of light curve classification pipelines, trained on 518
spectroscopically-classified SNe from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium-Deep Survey
(PS1-MDS): 357 Type Ia, 93 Type II, 25 Type IIn, 21 Type Ibc, and 17 Type I
SLSNe. We present a new parametric analytical model that can accommodate a
broad range of SN light curve morphologies, including those with a plateau, and
fit this model to data in four PS1 filters (griz). We test a number of feature
extraction methods, data augmentation strategies, and machine learning
algorithms to predict the class of each SN. Our best pipelines result in 90%
average accuracy, 70% average purity, and 80% average completeness for all SN
classes, with the highest success rates for Type Ia SNe and SLSNe and the
lowest for Type Ibc SNe. Despite the greater complexity of our classification
scheme, the purity of our Type Ia SN classification, 95%, is on par with
methods developed specifically for Type Ia versus non-Type Ia binary
classification. As the first of its kind, this study serves as a guide to
developing and training classification algorithms for a wide range of SN types
with a purely empirical training set, particularly one that is similar in its
characteristics to the expected LSST main survey strategy. Future work will
implement this classification pipeline on ~3000 PS1/MDS light curves that lack
spectroscopic classification.",2019-05-17T18:18:25Z
The Milky Way Project Second Data Release: Bubbles and Bow Shocks,"Citizen science has helped astronomers comb through large data sets to
identify patterns and objects that are not easily found through automated
processes. The Milky Way Project (MWP), a citizen science initiative on the
Zooniverse platform, presents internet users with infrared (IR) images from
Spitzer Space Telescope Galactic plane surveys. MWP volunteers make
classification drawings on the images to identify targeted classes of
astronomical objects. We present the MWP second data release (DR2) and an
updated data reduction pipeline written in Python. We aggregate ${\sim}3$
million classifications made by MWP volunteers during the years 2012-2017 to
produce the DR2 catalogue, which contains 2600 IR bubbles and 599 candidate
bow-shock driving stars. The reliability of bubble identifications, as assessed
by comparison to visual identifications by trained experts and scoring by a
machine-learning algorithm, is found to be a significant improvement over DR1.
We assess the reliability of IR bow shocks via comparison to expert
identifications and the colours of candidate bow-shock driving stars in the
2MASS point-source catalogue. We hence identify highly-reliable subsets of 1394
DR2 bubbles and 453 bow-shock driving stars. Uncertainties on object
coordinates and bubble size/shape parameters are included in the DR2 catalog.
Compared with DR1, the DR2 bubbles catalogue provides more accurate shapes and
sizes. The DR2 catalogue identifies 311 new bow shock driving star candidates,
including three associated with the giant HII regions NGC 3603 and RCW 49.",2019-05-28T18:00:00Z
"Compact planetary nebulae: Improved IR diagnostic criteria based on
  classification tree modelling","Planetary nebulae (PNe) are strong H$\alpha$ line-emitters and a lot of new
PNe discoveries have been made by the SuperCOSMOS AAO/UKST H$\alpha$ Survey
(SHS) and the Isaac Newton Telescope Photometric H$\alpha$ Survey (IPHAS).
However, the list of auto-generated H$\alpha$-excess candidates from these
surveys as well as any photometric survey, prior to spectroscopic follow-up to
confirm their nature, contains all varieties of H$\alpha$-line emitters like
young stellar objects (YSOs), H II regions, compact PNe and emission line stars
of all kinds. The aim of this work is to find new infrared criteria that can
better distinguish compact PNe from their mimics using a machine learning
approach and the photometric data from the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey and
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. Three classification tree models have been
developed with the following colour criteria: W1-W4$\ge$7.87 and J-H$<$1.10;
H-W2$\ge$2.24 and J-H$<$0.50; and Ks-W3$\ge$6.42 and J-H$<$1.31 providing a
list of candidates, characterized by a high probability to be genuine PNe. The
contamination of this list of candidates from Ha mimics is low but not
negligible. By applying these criteria to the IPHAS list of PN candidates and
the entire IPHAS and VPHAS+ DR2 catalogues, we find 141 sources, from which 92
are known PNe, 39 are new very likely compact PNe (without an available
classification or uncertain) and 10 are classified as H II regions, Wolf-Rayet
stars, AeBe stars and YSOs. The occurrence of false positive identifications in
this technique is between 10 and 15 per cent.",2019-07-23T17:33:58Z
"Informing the Cataclysmic Variable Donor Sequence from Gaia DR2
  Color-Magnitude and Inferred Variability Metrics","Short-period cataclysmic variables (spCVs), with orbital periods below the
period gap ($P_{orb}$ < 2 hr), offer insight into the evolutionary models of
CVs and can serve as strong emitters of gravitational waves (GWs). To identify
new spCV candidates, we crossmatch a catalog of known CVs to sources with
robust parallaxes in the Gaia second data release (DR2). We uncover and fit an
apparently monotonic relationship between the color--absolute-magnitude diagram
(CMD) position and $P_{orb}$ of these CVs, revealed in DR2. To supplement this
relation, we develop a method for identifying sources with large photometric
variability, a characteristic trait of spCVs. Using all available Gaia light
curves, we construct a machine-learned regression model to predict variability
metrics for sources in the CMD locus of known spCVs based solely on
time-averaged covariates present in DR2. Using this approach we identify 3,253
candidate spCVs, of which $\sim$95% are previously unknown. Inspection of
archival SDSS spectra of these candidates suggests that $>$82% are likely to be
spCVs: a noticeably higher recovery rate than previous light curve searches,
which bias toward active systems. We obtain optical spectra of 9 new systems at
Lick Observatory and confirm that all objects are CV systems. We measure
$P_{orb}$ for 7 systems using archival Gaia and Palomar Transient Factory light
curves, 3 of which do not have previous $P_{orb}$ measurements. We use the
CMD-$P_{orb}$ relation to infer the detectability of these systems to the
upcoming LISA mission, and find that six sources may be coherent LISA
verification binaries, with an estimated SNR > 5 in the 4 yr mission. This
paper demonstrates that the time-averaged Gaia catalog is a powerful tool in
the methodical discovery and characterization of time-varying objects, making
it complementary to missions like ZTF, TESS, and the Vera Rubin LSST.",2020-11-24T17:52:52Z
"Classification of High-resolution Solar Hα Spectra using
  t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding","The H{\alpha} spectral line is a well-studied absorption line revealing
properties of the highly structured and dynamic solar chromosphere. Typical
features with distinct spectral signatures in H{\alpha} include filaments and
prominences, bright active-region plages, superpenumbrae around sunspots,
surges, flares, Ellerman bombs, filigree, and mottles and rosettes, among
others. This study is based on high-spectral resolution H{\alpha} spectra
obtained with the echelle spectrograph of the Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT)
located at Observatorio del Teide (ODT), Tenerife, Spain. The t-distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a machine learning algorithm, which is
used for nonlinear dimensionality reduction. In this application, it projects
H{\alpha} spectra onto a two-dimensional map, where it becomes possible to
classify the spectra according to results of Cloud Model (CM) inversions. The
CM parameters optical depth, Doppler width, line-of-sight velocity, and source
function describe properties of the cloud material. Initial results of t-SNE
indicate its strong discriminatory power to separate quiet-Sun and plage
profiles from those that are suitable for CM inversions. In addition, a
detailed study of various t-SNE parameters is conducted, the impact of seeing
conditions on the classification is assessed, results for various types of
input data are compared, and the identified clusters are linked to
chromospheric features. Although t-SNE proves to be efficient in clustering
high-dimensional data, human inference is required at each step to interpret
the results. This exploratory study provides a framework and ideas on how to
tailor a classification scheme towards specific spectral data and science
questions.",2020-11-26T10:17:12Z
"3D Morphology of Open Clusters in the Solar Neighborhood with Gaia EDR3:
  its Relation to Cluster Dynamics","We analyze the 3D morphology and kinematics of 13 open clusters (OCs) located
within 500 pc of the Sun, using Gaia EDR3 and kinematic data from literature.
Members of OCs are identified using the unsupervised machine learning method
StarGO, using 5D parameters (X, Y, Z, $\mu_\alpha \cos\delta, \mu_\delta$). The
OC sample covers an age range of 25Myr--2.65Gyr. We correct the asymmetric
distance distribution due to the parallax error using Bayesian inversion. The
uncertainty in the corrected distance for a cluster at 500~pc is 3.0--6.3~pc,
depending on the intrinsic spatial distribution of its members. We determine
the 3D morphology of the OCs in our sample and fit the spatial distribution of
stars within the tidal radius in each cluster with an ellipsoid model. The
shapes of the OCs are well-described with oblate spheroids (NGC2547, NGC2516,
NGC2451A, NGC2451B, NGC2232), prolate spheroids (IC2602, IC4665, NGC2422,
Blanco1, Coma Berenices), or triaxial ellipsoids (IC2391, NGC6633, NGC6774).
The semi-major axis of the fitted ellipsoid is parallel to the Galactic plane
for most clusters. Elongated filament-like substructures are detected in three
young clusters (NGC2232, NGC2547, NGC2451B), while tidal-tail-like
substructures (tidal tails) are found in older clusters (NGC2516, NGC6633,
NGC6774, Blanco1, Coma Berenices). Most clusters may be super-virial and
expanding. $N$-body models of rapid gas expulsion with an SFE of $\approx 1/3$
are consistent with clusters more massive than $250\rm M_\odot$, while clusters
less massive than 250$\rm M_\odot$ tend to agree with adiabatic gas expulsion
models. Only six OCs (NGC2422, NGC6633, and NGC6774, NGC2232, Blanco1, Coma
Berenices) show clear signs of mass segregation.",2021-02-21T04:55:22Z
"Nonthermal electron velocity distribution functions due to 3D kinetic
  magnetic reconnection for solar coronal plasma conditions","Magnetic reconnection can convert magnetic energy into kinetic energy of
non-thermal electron beams. Those accelerated electrons can, in turn, cause
radio emission in astrophysical plasma environments such as solar flares via
micro-instabilities. The properties of the electron velocity distribution
functions (EVDFs) of those non-thermal beams generated by reconnection are,
however, still not well understood. In particular properties that are necessary
conditions for some relevant micro-instabilities. We aim at characterizing the
EVDFs generated in 3D magnetic reconnection by means of fully kinetic
particle-in-cell (PIC) code simulations. In particular, our goal is to identify
the possible sources of free energy offered by the generated EVDFs and their
dependence on the strength of the guide field. By applying a machine learning
algorithm on the EVDFs, we find that: (1) electron beams with positive
gradients in their 1D parallel (to the local magnetic field direction) velocity
distribution functions are generated in both diffusion region and separatrices.
(2) Electron beams with positive gradients in their perpendicular (to the local
magnetic field direction) velocity distribution functions are observed in the
diffusion region and outflow region near the reconnection midplane. In
particular, perpendicular crescent-shaped EVDFs (in the perpendicular velocity
space) are mainly observed in the diffusion region. (3) As the guide field
strength increases, the number of locations with EVDFs featuring a
perpendicular source of free energy significantly decreases. The formation of
non-thermal electron beams in the field-aligned direction is mainly due to
magnetized and adiabatic electrons, while in the direction perpendicular to the
local magnetic field it is attributed to unmagnetized electrons.",2021-06-23T17:30:48Z
On The XUV Luminosity Evolution of TRAPPIST-1,"We model the long-term XUV luminosity of TRAPPIST-1 to constrain the evolving
high-energy radiation environment experienced by its planetary system. Using
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we derive probabilistic constraints for
TRAPPIST-1's stellar and XUV evolution that account for observational
uncertainties, degeneracies between model parameters, and empirical data of
low-mass stars. We constrain TRAPPIST-1's mass to $m_{\star} = 0.089
\pm{0.001}$ M$_{\odot}$ and find that its early XUV luminosity likely saturated
at $\log_{10}(L_{XUV}/L_{bol}) = -3.03^{+0.23}_{-0.12}$. From the posterior
distribution, we infer that there is a ${\sim}40\%$ chance that TRAPPIST-1 is
still in the saturated phase today, suggesting that TRAPPIST-1 has maintained
high activity and $L_{XUV}/L_{bol} \approx 10^{-3}$ for several Gyrs.
TRAPPIST-1's planetary system therefore likely experienced a persistent and
extreme XUV flux environment, potentially driving significant atmospheric
erosion and volatile loss. The inner planets likely received XUV fluxes
${\sim}10^3 - 10^4\times$ that of the modern Earth during TRAPPIST-1's
${\sim}1$ Gyr-long pre-main sequence phase. Deriving these constraints via MCMC
is computationally non-trivial, so scaling our methods to constrain the XUV
evolution of a larger number of M dwarfs that harbor terrestrial exoplanets
would incur significant computational expenses. We demonstrate that
approxposterior, an open source Python machine learning package for approximate
Bayesian inference using Gaussian processes, accurately and efficiently
replicates our analysis using $980\times$ less computational time and
$1330\times$ fewer simulations than MCMC sampling using emcee. We find that
approxposterior derives constraints with mean errors on the best fit values and
$1\sigma$ uncertainties of $0.61\%$ and $5.5\%$, respectively, relative to
emcee.",2019-06-12T17:17:05Z
"Constraints on the Galactic Inner Halo Assembly History from the Age
  Gradient of Blue Horizontal-branch Stars","We present an analysis of the relative age distribution of the Milky Way
halo, based on samples of blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars obtained from the
Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System and \textit{Galaxy
Evolution Explorer} photometry, as well a Sloan Digital Sky Survey
spectroscopic sample. A machine-learning approach to the selection of BHB stars
is developed, using support vector classification, with which we produce
chronographic age maps of the Milky Way halo out to 40\,kpc from the Galactic
center. We identify a characteristic break in the relative age profiles of our
BHB samples, corresponding to a Galactocentric radius of $R_{\rm{GC}} \sim
14$\,kpc. Within the break radius, we find an age gradient of $-63.4 \pm 8.2$
Myr kpc$^{-1}$, which is significantly steeper than obtained by previous
studies that did not discern between the inner- and outer-halo regions. The
gradient in the relative age profile and the break radius signatures persist
after correcting for the influence of metallicity on our spectroscopic
calibration sample. We conclude that neither are due to the previously
recognized metallicity gradient in the halo, as one passes from the inner-halo
to the outer-halo region. Our results are consistent with a dissipational
formation of the inner-halo population, involving a few relatively massive
progenitor satellites, such as those proposed to account for the assembly of
\textit{Gaia}-Enceladus, which then merged with the inner halo of the Milky
Way.",2019-09-27T20:42:42Z
Physical Properties of the star-forming clusters in NGC 6334,"We have studied the high-mass star-forming complex NGC 6334 with ALMA in the
continuum emission at a frequency of 87.6 GHz, achieving a spatial resolution
of 1300 au. Detecting 142 compact sources distributed over the whole observed
area, we then used machine learning algorithms to group the compact cores in
different clusters. A total of four main clusters were identified: NGC 6334-E,
NGC 6334-I, NGC 6334-I(N) and NGC 6334-I(NW). The typical separations between
cluster members (4000-12000 au) together with the core masses (0.2-100
$M_{\odot}$) are in agreement with turbulent fragmentation at scales of 0.1 pc.
We find that the CMFs (core mass functions) show an excess of massive cores
compared to the IMF. Typical uncertainties in temperature or unresolved
multiplicity may mimic the observed excess of massive cores. Evidence of mass
segregation in NGC 6334-I and NGC 6334-I(N), with the most massive cores
located closer to the center, was found. Correlations between the physical
properties of the clusters and their evolutionary stage were searched for, and
found to show a larger separation between cores in the more evolved clusters,
favouring the role of gas expulsion and stellar ejection over time. From these
results, we suggest that NGC 6334-I(N) was primordially segregated, while NGC
6334-I may have become mass-segregated over time due to dynamical effects.
Finally, the lack of massive cores in the most evolved cluster suggests that
the gas reservoir may be already exhausted, while the less evolved clusters
still have access to a larger gas mass reservoir. In general, the fragmentation
in NGC 6334 at large scales (about 1 pc) is governed by turbulent pressure,
while at smaller scales (a few hundred au), thermal pressure regulates the
fragmentation process.",2019-11-15T11:58:55Z
"Multivariate Time-series Analysis of Variable Objects in the Gaia
  Mission","In astronomy, we are witnessing an enormous increase in the number of source
detections, precision, and diversity of measurements. Additionally, multi-epoch
data is becoming the norm, making time-series analyses an important aspect of
current astronomy. The Gaia mission is an outstanding example of a multi-epoch
survey that provides measurements in a large diversity of domains, with its
broad-band photometry; spectrophotometry in blue and red (used to derive
astrophysical parameters); spectroscopy (employed to infer radial velocities, v
sin(i), and other astrophysical parameters); and its extremely precise
astrometry. Most of all that information is provided for sources covering the
entire sky. Here, we present several properties related to the Gaia time
series, such as the time sampling; the different types of measurements; the
Gaia G, G BP and G RP-band photometry; and Gaia-inspired studies using the
CORrelation-RAdial-VELocities data to assess the potential of the information
on the radial velocity, the FWHM, and the contrast of the cross-correlation
function. We also present techniques (which are used or are under development)
that optimize the extraction of astrophysical information from the different
instruments of Gaia, such as the principal component analysis and the
multi-response regression. The detailed understanding of the behavior of the
observed phenomena in the various measurement domains can lead to richer and
more precise characterization of the Gaia data, including the definition of
more informative attributes that serve as input to (our) machine-learning
algorithms.",2019-11-20T19:00:01Z
Different Fates of Young Star Clusters After Gas Expulsion,"We identify structures of the young star cluster NGC 2232 in the solar
neighborhood (323.0 pc), and a newly discovered star cluster LP 2439 (289.1
pc). Member candidates are identified using the Gaia DR2 sky position, parallax
and proper motion data, by an unsupervised machine learning method,
\textsc{StarGO}. Member contamination from the Galactic disk is further removed
using the color magnitude diagram. The four identified groups (NGC 2232, LP
2439 and two filamentary structures) of stars are coeval with an age of 25 Myr
and were likely formed in the same giant molecular cloud. We correct the
distance asymmetry from the parallax error with a Bayesian method. The 3D
morphology shows the two spherical distributions of clusters NGC 2232 and LP
2439. Two filamentary structures are spatially and kinematically connected to
NGC 2232. Both NGC 2232 and LP 2439 are expanding. The expansion is more
significant in LP 2439, generating a loose spatial distribution with shallow
volume number and mass density profiles. The expansion is suggested to be
mainly driven by gas expulsion. NGC 2232, with 73~percent of the cluster mass
bound, is currently experiencing a process of re-virialization, However, LP
2439, with 52 percent cluster mass being unbound, may fully dissolve in the
near future. The different survivability traces different dynamical states of
NGC 2232 and LP 2439 prior to the onset of gas expulsion. NGC 2232 may have
been substructured and subvirial, while LP 2439 may either have been
virial/supervirial, or it has experienced a much faster rate of gas removal.",2020-08-06T18:00:00Z
"Mapping the Galactic disk with the LAMOST and $Gaia$ Red clump sample:
  V: On the origin of the ""young"" [$α$/Fe]-enhanced stars","Using a sample of nearly 140,000 primary red clump stars selected from the
LAMOST and $Gaia$ surveys, we have identified a large sample of ""young""
[$\alpha$/Fe]-enhanced stars with stellar ages younger than 6.0 Gyr and
[$\alpha$/Fe] ratios greater than 0.15 dex. The stellar ages and [$\alpha$/Fe]
ratios are measured from LAMOST spectra, using a machine learning method
trained with common stars in the LAMOST-APOGEE fields (for [$\alpha$/Fe]) and
in the LAMOST-$Kepler$ fields (for stellar age). The existence of these ""young""
[$\alpha$/Fe]-enhanced stars is not expected from the classical Galactic
chemical evolution models. To explore their possible origins, we have analyzed
the spatial distribution, and the chemical and kinematic properties of those
stars and compared the results with those of the chemically thin and thick disk
populations. We find that those ""young"" [$\alpha$/Fe]-enhanced stars have
distributions in number density, metallicity, [C/N] abundance ratio, velocity
dispersion and orbital eccentricity that are essentially the same as those of
the chemically thick disk population. Our results clearly show those so-called
""young"" [$\alpha$/Fe]-enhanced stars are not really young but $genuinely$
$old$. Although other alternative explanations can not be fully ruled out, our
results suggest that the most possible origin of these old stars is the result
of stellar mergers or mass transfer.",2020-08-24T06:41:07Z
"Measuring Young Stars in Space and Time -- I. The Photometric Catalog
  and Extinction Properties of N44","In order to better understand the role of high-mass stellar feedback in
regulating star formation in giant molecular clouds, we carried out a Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) Treasury Program ""Measuring Young Stars in Space and
Time"" (MYSST) targeting the star-forming complex N44 in the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC). Using the F555W and F814W broadband filters of both the ACS and
WFC3/UVIS, we built a photometric catalog of 461,684 stars down to
$m_\mathrm{F555W} \simeq 29$ mag and $m_\mathrm{F814W} \simeq 28$ mag,
corresponding to the magnitude of an unreddened 1 Myr pre-main-sequence star of
$\approx0.09$ $M_\odot$ at the LMC distance. In this first paper we describe
the observing strategy of MYSST, the data reduction procedure, and present the
photometric catalog. We identify multiple young stellar populations tracing the
gaseous rim of N44's super bubble, together with various contaminants belonging
to the LMC field population. We also determine the reddening properties from
the slope of the elongated red clump feature by applying the machine learning
algorithm RANSAC, and we select a set of Upper Main Sequence (UMS) stars as
primary probes to build an extinction map, deriving a relatively modest median
extinction $A_{\mathrm{F555W}}\simeq0.77$ mag. The same procedure applied to
the red clump provides $A_{\mathrm{F555W}}\simeq 0.68$ mag.",2020-12-01T14:33:01Z
"The K2 Galactic Archaeology Program Data Release 2: Asteroseismic
  results from campaigns 4, 6, & 7","Studies of Galactic structure and evolution have benefitted enormously from
Gaia kinematic information, though additional, intrinsic stellar parameters
like age are required to best constrain Galactic models. Asteroseismology is
the most precise method of providing such information for field star
populations $\textit{en masse}$, but existing samples for the most part have
been limited to a few narrow fields of view by the CoRoT and Kepler missions.
In an effort to provide well-characterized stellar parameters across a wide
range in Galactic position, we present the second data release of red giant
asteroseismic parameters for the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program (GAP). We
provide $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $\Delta \nu$ based on six independent pipeline
analyses; first-ascent red giant branch (RGB) and red clump (RC) evolutionary
state classifications from machine learning; and ready-to-use radius & mass
coefficients, $\kappa_R$ & $\kappa_M$, which, when appropriately multiplied by
a solar-scaled effective temperature factor, yield physical stellar radii and
masses. In total, we report 4395 radius and mass coefficients, with typical
uncertainties of $3.3\% \mathrm{\ (stat.)} \pm 1\% \mathrm{\ (syst.)}$ for
$\kappa_R$ and $7.7\% \mathrm{\ (stat.)} \pm 2\% \mathrm{\ (syst.)}$ for
$\kappa_M$ among RGB stars, and $5.0\% \mathrm{\ (stat.)} \pm 1\% \mathrm{\
(syst.)}$ for $\kappa_R$ and $10.5\% \mathrm{\ (stat.)} \pm 2\% \mathrm{\
(syst.)}$ for $\kappa_M$ among RC stars. We verify that the sample is nearly
complete -- except for a dearth of stars with $\nu_{\mathrm{max}} \lesssim
10-20\mu$Hz -- by comparing to Galactic models and visual inspection. Our
asteroseismic radii agree with radii derived from Gaia Data Release 2
parallaxes to within $2.2 \pm 0.3\%$ for RGB stars and $2.0 \pm 0.6\%$ for RC
stars.",2020-12-07T20:54:51Z
"How to Train Your Flare Prediction Model: Revisiting Robust Sampling of
  Rare Events","We present a case study of solar flare forecasting by means of metadata
feature time series, by treating it as a prominent class-imbalance and
temporally coherent problem. Taking full advantage of pre-flare time series in
solar active regions is made possible via the Space Weather Analytics for Solar
Flares (SWAN-SF) benchmark dataset; a partitioned collection of multivariate
time series of active region properties comprising 4075 regions and spanning
over 9 years of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) period of operations. We
showcase the general concept of temporal coherence triggered by the demand of
continuity in time series forecasting and show that lack of proper
understanding of this effect may spuriously enhance models' performance. We
further address another well-known challenge in rare event prediction, namely,
the class-imbalance issue. The SWAN-SF is an appropriate dataset for this, with
a 60:1 imbalance ratio for GOES M- and X-class flares and a 800:1 for X-class
flares against flare-quiet instances. We revisit the main remedies for these
challenges and present several experiments to illustrate the exact impact that
each of these remedies may have on performance. Moreover, we acknowledge that
some basic data manipulation tasks such as data normalization and cross
validation may also impact the performance -- we discuss these problems as
well. In this framework we also review the primary advantages and disadvantages
of using true skill statistic and Heidke skill score, as two widely used
performance verification metrics for the flare forecasting task. In conclusion,
we show and advocate for the benefits of time series vs. point-in-time
forecasting, provided that the above challenges are measurably and
quantitatively addressed.",2021-03-12T21:37:08Z
"The OGLE Collection of Variable Stars. Nearly 66,000 Mira stars in the
  Milky Way","We present a collection of 65,981 Mira-type variable stars found in the
Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) project database. Two-thirds of
our sample (40,356 objects) are located in the Galactic bulge fields, whereas
25,625 stars are in the Galactic disk. The vast majority of the collection
(47,532 objects) are new discoveries. We provide basic observational parameters
of the Mira variables: equatorial coordinates, pulsation periods, $I$-band and
$V$-band mean magnitudes, $I$-band brightness amplitudes, and identifications
in other catalogs of variable stars. We also provide the $I$-band and $V$-band
time-series photometry collected since 1997 during the OGLE-II, OGLE-III, and
OGLE-IV phases. The classical selection process, i.e., mostly based on the
visual inspection of light curves by experienced astronomers, led us to the
high purity of the catalog. As a result, this collection can be used as a
training set in the machine learning classification algorithms. Using
overlapping parts of adjacent OGLE fields, we estimate the completeness of the
catalog to be about 96%. We compare and discuss the statistical features of
Miras located in different regions of the Milky Way. We show examples of stars
that change their type over time, from a semi-regular variable to Mira and vice
versa. This dataset is perfectly suited to study the three-dimensional
structure of the Milky Way, and it may help to explain the puzzle of the
X-shaped bulge.",2022-03-30T18:00:01Z
"Low mass young stars in the Milky Way unveiled by DBSCAN and Gaia EDR3.
  Mapping the star forming regions within 1.5 Kpc","With an unprecedented astrometric and photometric data precision, Gaia EDR3
gives us, for the first time, the opportunity to systematically detect and map
in the optical bands, the low mass populations of the star forming regions
(SFRs) in the Milky Way. We provide a catalogue of the Gaia EDR3 data
(photometry, proper motions and parallaxes) of the young stellar objects (YSOs)
identified in the Galactic Plane (|b|<30 deg) within about 1.5 kpc. The
catalogue of the SFRs to which they belong is also provided to study the
properties of the very young clusters and put them in the context of the Galaxy
structure. We applied the machine learning unsupervised clustering algorithm
DBSCAN on a sample of Gaia EDR3 data photometrically selected on the region
where very young stars (t<10 Myr) are expected to be found, with the aim to
identify co-moving and spatially consistent stellar clusters. A subsample of 52
clusters, selected among the 7323 found with DBSCAN, has been used as template
data set, to identify very young clusters from the pattern of the observed
color-absolute magnitude diagrams through a pattern match process. We find
124440 candidate YSOs clustered in 354 SFRs and stellar clusters younger than
10 Myr and within about 1.5 Kpc. In addition, 65863 low mass members of 322
stellar clusters located within about 500 pc and with ages 10 Myr<t<100 Myr
were also found. The selected YSOs are spatially correlated with the well known
SFRs. Most of them are associated with well concentrated regions or complex
structures of the Galaxy and a substantial number of them have been recognized
for the first time. The massive SFRs, such as, for example, Orion, Sco-Cen and
Vela, located within 600-700 pc trace a very complex three-dimensional pattern,
while the farthest ones seem to follow a more regular pattern along the
Galactic Plane.",2022-06-01T06:11:12Z
"What can Gaussian Processes really tell us about supernova lightcurves?
  Consequences for Type II(b) morphologies and genealogies","Machine learning has become widely used in astronomy. Gaussian Process (GP)
regression in particular has been employed a number of times to fit or
re-sample supernova (SN) light-curves, however by their nature typical GP
models are not suited to fit SN photometric data and they will be prone to
over-fitting. Recently GP re-sampling was used in the context of studying the
morphologies of type II and IIb SNe and they were found to be clearly distinct
with respect to four parameters: the rise time (t$_{\rm rise}$), the magnitude
difference between 40 and 30 days post explosion ($\Delta m_{\rm 40-30}$), the
earliest maximum (post-peak) of the first derivative (dm1) and minimum of the
second derivative (dm2). Here we take a close look at GP regression and its
limitations in the context of SN light-curves in general, and we also discuss
the uncertainties on these specific parameters, finding that dm1 and dm2 cannot
give reliable astrophysical information. We do reproduce the clustering in
t$_{\rm rise}$--$\Delta m_{\rm 40-30}$ space although it is not as clear cut as
previously presented. The best strategy to accurately populate the t$_{\rm
rise}$-- $\Delta m_{\rm 40-30}$ space will be to use an expanded sample of high
quality light-curves (such as those in the ATLAS transient survey) and
analytical fitting methods. Finally, using the BPASS fiducial models, we
predict that future photometric studies will reveal clear clustering of the
type IIb and II light curve morphologies with a distinct continuum of
transitional events.",2022-06-29T18:00:00Z
"Searching for the extra-tidal stars of globular clusters using
  high-dimensional analysis and a core particle spray code","Three-body interactions can eject stars from the core of a globular cluster,
causing them to enter the Galactic halo as extra-tidal stars. While finding
extra-tidal stars is imperative for understanding cluster evolution, connecting
isolated extra-tidal field stars back to their birth cluster is extremely
difficult. In this work, we present a new methodology consisting of
high-dimensional data analysis and a particle spray code to identify
extra-tidal stars of any Galactic globular cluster using M3 as a case study.
Using the t-Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) and Uniform Manifold
Approximation and Projection (UMAP) machine learning dimensionality reduction
algorithms, we first identify a set of 103 extra-tidal candidates in the APOGEE
DR17 data catalogue with chemical abundances similar to M3 stars. To confirm
each candidate's extra-tidal nature, we introduce corespray - a new
Python-based three-body particle spray code that simulates extra-tidal stars
for any Galactic globular cluster. Using Gaia EDR3 proper motions and APOGEE
DR17 radial velocities, we apply multivariate Gaussian modelling and an extreme
deconvolution to identify the extra-tidal candidates that are more likely to be
associated with a distribution of corespray-simulated M3 extra-tidal stars than
the field. Through these methods, we identify 10 new high-probability
extra-tidal stars produced via three-body interactions in M3. We also explore
whether any of our extra-tidal candidates are consistent with being ejected
from M3 through different dynamical processes. Future applications of corespray
will yield better understandings of core dynamics, star formation histories and
binary fractions in globular clusters.",2022-07-22T18:00:01Z
FarNet-II: An improved solar far-side active region detection method,"Context. Activity on the far side of the Sun is routinely studied through the
analysis of the seismic oscillations detected on the near side using
helioseismic techniques such as phase shift sensitive holography. Recently, the
neural network FarNet was developed to improve these detections. Aims. We aim
to create a new machine learning tool, FarNet II, which further increases the
scope of FarNet, and to evaluate its performance in comparison to FarNet and
the standard helioseismic method for detecting far side activity. Methods. We
developed FarNet II, a neural network that retains some of the general
characteristics of FarNet but improves the detections in general, as well as
the temporal coherence among successive predictions. The main novelties are the
implementation of attention and convolutional long short term memory (ConvLSTM)
modules. A cross validation approach, training the network 37 times with a
different validation set for each run, was employed to leverage the limited
amount of data available. We evaluate the performance of FarNet II using three
years of extreme ultraviolet observations of the far side of the Sun acquired
with the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) as a proxy of
activity. The results from FarNet II were compared with those obtained from
FarNet and the standard helioseismic method using the Dice coefficient as a
metric. Results. FarNet II achieves a Dice coefficient that improves that of
FarNet by over 0.2 points for every output position on the sequences from the
evaluation dates. Its improvement over FarNet is higher than that of FarNet
over the standard method. Conclusions. The new network is a very promising tool
for improving the detection of activity on the far side of the Sun given by
pure helioseismic techniques. Space weather forecasts can potentially benefit
from the higher sensitivity provided by this novel method.",2022-09-29T13:55:55Z
"Research on the quantity and brightness evolution characteristics of
  Photospheric Bright Points groups","Context. Photospheric bright points (BPs), as the smallest magnetic element
of the photosphere and the footpoint tracer of the magnetic flux tube, are of
great significance to the study of BPs. Compared with the study of the
characteristics and evolution of a few specific BPs, the study of BPs groups
can provide us with a better understanding of the characteristics and overall
activities of BPs groups. Aims. We aim to find out the evolution
characteristics of the brightness and number of BPs groups at different
brightness levels, and how these characteristics differ between quiet and
active regions. Methods. We propose a hybrid BPs detection model (HBD Model)
combining traditional technology and neural network. The Model is used to
detect and calculate the BPs brightness characteristics of each frame of
continuous high resolution image sequences of active and quiet regions in
TiO-band of a pair of BBSO. Using machine learning clustering method, the PBs
of each frame was divided into four levels groups (level1-level4) according to
the brightness from low to high. Finally, Fourier transform and inverse Fourier
transform are used to analyze the evolution of BPs brightness and quantity in
these four levels groups. Results. The activities of BPs groups are not random
and disorderly. In different levels of brightness, their quantity and
brightness evolution show complex changes. Among the four levels of brightness,
BPs in the active region were more active and intense than those in the quiet
region. However, the quantity and brightness evolution of BPs groups in the
quiet region showed the characteristics of large periodic changes and small
periodic changes in the medium and high brightness levels (level3 and level4).
The brightness evolution of PBs group in the quiet region has obvious periodic
changes, but the active region is in a completely random and violent
fluctuation state.",2022-10-06T02:01:29Z
"Theoretical investigation of the occurrence of tidally excited
  oscillations in massive eccentric binary systems","Massive and intermediate-mass stars reside in binary systems much more
frequently than low-mass stars. Binaries containing massive main-sequence (MS)
component(s) are often characterised by eccentric orbits, and can be observed
as eccentric ellipsoidal variables (EEVs). The orbital phase-dependent tidal
potential acting on the components of EEV can induce tidally excited
oscillations (TEOs). We investigate how the history of resonances between the
eigenmode spectra of the EEV components and the tidal forcing frequencies
depends on the initial parameters of the system. We synthesised 20,000
evolutionary models of the EEVs across the MS. Later, we calculated the
eigenfrequencies for each model. We focused only on the $l=2$, $m=0,+2$ modes.
Knowing the temporal changes in the orbital parameters of simulated EEVs and
the changes of the eigenfrequency spectra for both components, we were able to
determine so-called `resonance curves', which describe the overall chance of a
resonance occurring. We analysed the resonance curves by constructing basic
statistics for them and analysing their morphology using machine learning
methods, including the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection tool. The
EEV resonance curves from our sample are characterised by striking diversity,
including the occurrence of exceptionally long resonances or the absence of
resonances for long evolutionary times. Both components may be subject to
increased resonance rates as they approach the TAMS. On average, we should
observe TEOs more frequently in EEVs containing massive components than
intermediate-mass ones. TEOs will be particularly well-pronounced for EEVs with
the component(s) close to the TAMS. Given the total number of resonances and
their rates, TEOs may play an important role in the transport of angular
momentum within massive and intermediate-mass stars (mainly near TAMS).",2023-01-02T15:51:46Z
"Membership analysis and 3D kinematics of the star-forming complex around
  Trumpler 37 using Gaia-DR3","Identifying and characterizing young populations of star-forming regions is
crucial to unravel their properties. In this regard, Gaia-DR3 data and machine
learning tools are very useful for studying large star-forming complexes. In
this work, we analyze the $\rm \sim7.1degree^2$ area of one of our Galaxy's
dominant feedback-driven star-forming complexes, i.e., the region around
Trumpler 37. Using the Gaussian mixture and random forest classifier methods,
we identify 1243 high-probable members in the complex, of which $\sim60\%$ are
new members and are complete down to the mass limit of $\sim$0.1 $-$ 0.2~$\rm
M_{\odot}$. The spatial distribution of the stars reveals multiple clusters
towards the complex, where the central cluster around the massive star HD
206267 reveals two sub-clusters. Of the 1243 stars, 152 have radial velocity,
with a mean value of $\rm -16.41\pm0.72~km/s$. We investigate stars' internal
and relative movement within the central cluster. The kinematic analysis shows
that the cluster's expansion is relatively slow compared to the whole complex.
This slow expansion is possibly due to newly formed young stars within the
cluster. We discuss these results in the context of hierarchical collapse and
feedback-induced collapse mode of star formation in the complex.",2023-02-28T06:38:09Z
"Magnetic activity evolution of solar-like stars: I. S_ph-Age relation
  derived from Kepler observations","The ages of solar-like stars have been at the center of many studies such as
exoplanet characterization or Galactic-archaeology. While ages are usually
computed from stellar evolution models, relations linking ages to other stellar
properties, such as rotation and magnetic activity, have been investigated.
With the large catalog of 55,232 rotation periods, $P_{\rm rot}$, and
photometric magnetic activity index, $S_{\rm ph}$ from Kepler data, we have the
opportunity to look for such magneto-gyro-chronology relations. Stellar ages
are obtained with two stellar evolution codes that include treatment of angular
momentum evolution, hence using $P_{\rm rot}$ as input in addition to classical
atmospheric parameters. We explore two different ways of predicting stellar
ages on three subsamples with spectroscopic observations: solar analogs, late-F
and G dwarfs, and K dwarfs. We first perform a Bayesian analysis to derive
relations between $S_{\rm ph}$ and ages between 1 and 5 Gyr, and other stellar
properties. For late-F and G dwarfs, and K dwarfs, the multivariate regression
favors the model with $P_{\rm rot}$ and $S_{\rm ph}$ with median differences of
0.1%.and 0.2% respectively. We also apply Machine Learning techniques with a
Random Forest algorithm to predict ages up to 14 Gyr with the same set of input
parameters. For late-F, G and K dwarfs together, predicted ages are on average
within 5.3% of the model ages and improve to 3.1% when including $P_{\rm rot}$.
These are very promising results for a quick age estimation for solar-like
stars with photometric observations, especially with current and future space
missions.",2023-06-20T16:27:55Z
"The ZTF Source Classification Project: III. A Catalog of Variable
  Sources","The classification of variable objects provides insight into a wide variety
of astrophysics ranging from stellar interiors to galactic nuclei. The Zwicky
Transient Facility (ZTF) provides time series observations that record the
variability of more than a billion sources. The scale of these data
necessitates automated approaches to make a thorough analysis. Building on
previous work, this paper reports the results of the ZTF Source Classification
Project (SCoPe), which trains neural network and XGBoost machine learning (ML)
algorithms to perform dichotomous classification of variable ZTF sources using
a manually constructed training set containing 170,632 light curves. We find
that several classifiers achieve high precision and recall scores, suggesting
the reliability of their predictions for 209,991,147 light curves across 77 ZTF
fields. We also identify the most important features for XGB classification and
compare the performance of the two ML algorithms, finding a pattern of higher
precision among XGB classifiers. The resulting classification catalog is
available to the public, and the software developed for SCoPe is open-source
and adaptable to future time-domain surveys.",2023-11-30T19:05:10Z
"UOCS-XI. Study of blue straggler stars in open cluster NGC 7142 using
  UVIT/AstroSat","We present a study of blue straggler stars (BSSs) of open cluster NGC 7142
using AstroSat/UVIT data and other archival data. Using a machine
learning-based algorithm, ML-MOC, on Gaia DR3 data, we find 546 sources as
cluster members. Based on the location on the Gaia color-magnitude diagram, we
identify ten BSS candidates, also detected in UVIT/F148W filter. We study the
variable nature of BSSs by constructing their light curves using the TESS data.
Two BSSs reported as eclipsing binaries in Gaia DR3 are confirmed to be
eclipsing binaries based on our analysis and also show the presence of hot
companions as per the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs).
The physical parameters of the hot companions of these two BSSs derived by
fitting binary models to their light curves and those derived from the SEDs are
found to be in good agreement. Additionally, five more BSSs in the cluster
shows UV excess, four of which are likely to have a hot companion based on
SEDs. The hot companions with the estimated temperatures $\sim$14000 $-$ 28000
K, radii $\sim$0.01 $-$ 0.05 R$_{\odot}$, and luminosities $\sim$0.03 $-$ 0.1
L$_{\odot}$, are inferred to be extremely low mass ($<$ 0.2 M$_{\odot}$),
low-mass (0.2 $-$ 0.4 M$_{\odot}$), normal-mass (0.4 $-$ 0.6 M$_{\odot}$), and
high-mass ($>$ 0.6 M$_{\odot}$) white dwarfs (WD). For the first time in an
open cluster, we find the entire range of masses in WDs found as hot companions
of BSSs. These masses imply that the Case-A/Case-B mass transfer as well as
merger are responsible for the formation of at least 60$\%$ of the BSSs of this
cluster.",2023-12-07T05:38:33Z
"UOCS-XII. A study of open cluster NGC 6940 using UVIT/AstroSat: cluster
  properties and exotic populations","We study an open cluster NGC 6940 using \textit{AstroSat}/UVIT data and other
archival data. This is an intermediate age cluster ($\sim$ 1 Gyr), located at
about 770 pc distance, harboring several exotic populations apart from normal
single and binary stars. We identify members of this cluster using a machine
learning algorithm, ML-MOC and identify 492 members, including 1 blue straggler
star (BSS), 2 yellow straggler stars (YSS), 11 blue lurker (BL) candidates, and
2 red clump (RC) stars. The cluster shows the effect of mass segregation, with
massive stars segregated the most into the cluster, followed by the equal-mass
binary members and the single low mass stars. We report the presence of an
extended main-sequence turn-off (eMSTO) feature in this cluster and suggest
that the age spread may be a contributing factor behind it. However, the effect
of stellar rotation, and the dust absorption needs to be examined more
comprehensively with a larger fraction of MSTO stars. All the sixteen sources
mentioned above have a counterpart in the UVIT/F169M filter. In order to
characterize them, we construct multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of 14 of these objects having no nearby sources within 3"". The BSS is
successfully fitted with a single-component SED. We find that three BLs, two
YSS, and one RC star have UV excess greater than 50$\%$ and successfully fit
two-component SEDs having hot companions. The parameters derived from the SEDs
imply that the hot companions of BLs and the RC star are low-mass and
normal-mass white dwarfs, whereas the hot companions of YSS are likely to be
subdwarf B (sdB) stars. We suggest that at least 6 out of 14 stars ($\sim$42
$\%$) are formed via mass transfer and/or merger pathways.",2023-12-21T06:46:22Z
"LAMOST J040901.83+329355.6 -- a new Galactic star with Wolf--Rayet
  characteristics on a post-AGB to CSPN transitional stage","The similarity in physical conditions in winds of low-mass post-asymptotic
giant branch stars and evolved massive stars leads to the appearance of an
interesting phenomenon of spectral mimicry. Due to that the discovery of every
new star with Wolf--Rayet spectrum requires special study of its evolutionary
status before it may be included in the list of Galactic Wolf--Rayet (WR)
stars. A couple of years ago LAMOST J040901.83+323955.6 (hereafter J0409+3239)
was selected as a WR star in LAMOST spectroscopic database by machine learning
methods. In this work we investigated its evolutionary status. Analyzing the
spatial location of J0409+3239, in the Galaxy and its position in the
color-magnitude diagram we concluded what J0409+3239, is instead a low mass
object with WR phenomenon. Its luminosity is $L*=1000 L_\odot$ and effective
temperature $T_{\rm eff}$=40,000 K. Using new and archival photometric data we
detected irregular variability on time scales from hours to tens of days with
amplitude up to $\approx0.2$ mag. Comparison of the spectrum obtained in 2022
with the one from 2014 also shows an evidence of spectral variability. The
absence of clearly detected circumstellar nebula does not allow to classify
J0409+3239, as [WR], i.e. a central star of planetary nebula (CSPN). However,
its position in Hertzsprung--Russell diagram suggests that J0409+3239, is a low
mass star caught in rare transitional phase to CSPN. Estimation of J0409+3239,
mass based on evolutionary tracks shows that it is less than $0.9~M_\odot$, and
thus the age of the Galaxy is barely enough for the star to evolve to its
current stage.",2023-12-26T02:40:58Z
The compact multi-planet system GJ 9827 revisited with ESPRESSO,"GJ 9827 is a bright, nearby K7V star orbited by two super-Earths and one
mini-Neptune on close-in orbits. The system was first discovered using K2 data
and then further characterized by other spectroscopic and photometric
instruments. Previous literature studies provide several mass measurements for
the three planets, however, with large variations and uncertainties. To better
constrain the planetary masses, we added high-precision radial velocity
measurements from ESPRESSO to published datasets from HARPS, HARPS-N, and HIRES
and we performed a Gaussian process analysis combining radial velocity and
photometric datasets from K2 and TESS. This method allowed us to model the
stellar activity signal and derive precise planetary parameters. We determined
planetary masses of $M_b = 4.28_{-0.33}^{+0.35}$ M${_\oplus}$, $M_c =
1.86_{-0.39}^{+0.37}$ M${_\oplus}$, and $M_d = 3.02_{-0.57}^{+0.58}$
M${_\oplus}$, and orbital periods of $1.208974 \pm 0.000001$ days for planet b,
$3.648103_{-0.000010}^{+0.000013}$ days for planet c, and $6.201812 \pm
0.000009$ days for planet d. We compared our results to literature values and
found that our derived uncertainties for the planetary mass, period, and radial
velocity amplitude are smaller than the previously determined uncertainties. We
modeled the interior composition of the three planets using the
machine-learning-based tool ExoMDN and conclude that GJ 9827 b and c have an
Earth-like composition, whereas GJ 9827 d has an hydrogen envelope, which,
together with its density, places it in the mini-Neptune regime.",2024-01-11T22:13:24Z
"BSEC method for unveiling open clusters and its application to Gaia DR3:
  83 new clusters","Open clusters (OCs) are common in the Milky Way, but most of them remain
undiscovered. There are numerous techniques (e.g., machine-learning algorithms)
available for the exploration of OCs. However, each method has its limitations
and therefore, different approaches to discovering OCs hold significant value.
We develop a comprehensive approach method to automatically explore the data
space and identify potential OC candidates with relatively reliable membership
determination. This approach combines the techniques of HDBSCAN, GMM, and a
novel cluster member identification technique, color excess constraint. The new
method exhibits efficiency in detecting OCs while ensuring precise
determination of cluster memberships. It is called Blind Search-Extra
Constraint (BSEC) method. It is successfully applied to the Gaia DR3, and 83
new OCs are found. This study also reports 621 new OC candidates with
discernible main sequence or red giant branch. The BSEC technique can discard
some false negatives of previous works, which takes about 3 percentage of known
clusters. As an extra constraint, color excess (or 2-color) constraint is
useful for removing fake cluster member stars from the clusters that are
identified from the positions and proper motions of stars, and getting more
precise CMDs, when differential reddening of member stars of a cluster is not
large (e.g., \DeltaE(G_BP -G_RP)<0.5 mag). It makes the CMDs of 15 percent
clusters clearer (in particular for the region near turnoff) and therefore is
helpful for CMD and stellar population studies. Our result suggests that color
excess constraint is more appropriate for clusters with small differential
reddening, such as globular clusters or older OCs, and clusters that the
distances of member stars cannot be determined accurately.",2024-01-19T14:28:35Z
"Evolved Massive Stars at Low-metallicity VII. the Lower Mass Limit of
  Red Supergiant Population in the Large Magellanic Cloud","The precise definition of the lower mass limit of red supergiant stars (RSGs)
is an open question in astrophysics and does not attract too much attention.
Here we assemble a spectroscopic evolved cool star sample with 6,602 targets,
including RSGs, asymptotic giant branch stars, and red giant branch stars, in
the Large Magellanic Cloud based on \textit{Gaia} DR3 and SDSS-IV/APOGEE-2. The
reference spectrum of each stellar population is built according to the
quantile range of relative intensity ($1\%\sim99\%$). Five different methods,
e.g., chi-square ($\chi^2$), cosine similarity (CS), machine learning (ML),
equivalent width (EW), and line ratio (LR), are used in order to separate
different stellar populations. The ML and $\chi^2$ provide the best and
relatively consistent prediction of certain population. The derived lower limit
of the RSG population is able to reach to the $\rm K_S$-band tip of red giant
branch ($\rm K_S~$$\approx12.0$ mag), indicating a luminosity as low as about
$10^{3.5}~L_{\sun}$, which corresponds to a stellar radius only about
$100~R_{\sun}$. Given the mass-luminosity relation of $L/L_\sun =f(M/M_\sun)^3$
with $f\approx15.5\pm3$ and taking into account of the mass loss of faint RSGs
up to now, the minimal initial mass of the RSG population would be about
$6.1\pm0.4~M_\sun$, which is much lower than the traditional threshold of
$8~M_\sun$ for the massive stars. This is the first spectroscopic evidence,
indicating that the lower mass limit of RSG population is around $6~M_\sun$.
However, the destinies of such faint RSGs are still elusive and may have large
impact on the stellar evolutionary and supernova models.",2024-01-29T01:50:03Z
"Minute-Cadence Observations of the LAMOST Fields with the TMTS V.
  Machine Learning Classification of TMTS Catalogues of Periodic Variable Stars","Periodic variables are always of great scientific interest in astrophysics.
Thanks to the rapid advancement of modern large-scale time-domain surveys, the
number of reported variable stars has experienced substantial growth for
several decades, which significantly deepened our comprehension of stellar
structure and binary evolution. The Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescopes
for Survey (TMTS) has started to monitor the LAMOST sky areas since 2020, with
a cadence of 1 minute. During the period from 2020 to 2022, this survey has
resulted in densely sampled light curves for ~ 30,000 variables of the maximum
powers in the Lomb-Scargle periodogram above the 5sigma threshold. In this
paper, we classified 11,638 variable stars into 6 main types using XGBoost and
Random Forest classifiers with accuracies of 98.83% and 98.73%, respectively.
Among them, 5301 (45.55%) variables are newly discovered, primarily consisting
of Delta Scuti stars, demonstrating the capability of TMTS in searching for
short-period variables. We cross-matched the catalogue with Gaia's second Data
Release (DR2) and LAMOST's seventh Data Release (DR7) to obtain important
physical parameters of the variables. We identified 5504 Delta Scuti stars
(including 4876 typical Delta Scuti stars and 628 high-amplitude Delta Scuti
stars), 5899 eclipsing binaries (including EA-, EB- and EW-type) and 226
candidates of RS Canum Venaticorum. Leveraging the metal abundance data
provided by LAMOST and the Galactic latitude, we discovered 8 candidates of SX
Phe stars within the class of ""Delta Scuti stars"". Moreover, with the help of
Gaia color-magnitude diagram, we identified 9 ZZ ceti stars.",2024-02-04T20:31:36Z
"A Statistical and Multiwavelength Photometric Analysis of a Young
  Embedded Open Star Cluster: IC 1590","We present a statistical and multiwavelength photometric studies of young
open cluster IC 1590. We identified 91 cluster members using $Gaia$ DR3
astrometry data using ensemble-based unsupervised machine learning techniques.
From $Gaia$ EDR3 data, we estimate the best-fitted parameters for IC 1590 using
the Automated Stellar Cluster Analysis package (ASteCA) yielding the distance
$d$ $\sim$ 2.87 $\pm$ 0.02 Kpc, age $\sim$ 3.54 $\pm$ 0.05 Myr, metallicity $z$
$\sim$ 0.0212 $\pm$ 0.003, binarity value of $\sim$ 0.558, and extinction $A_v$
$\sim$ 1.252 $\pm$ 0.4 mag for an $R_v$ value of $\sim$ 3.322 $\pm$ 0.23. We
estimate the initial mass function slope of the cluster to be $\alpha$ = 1.081
$\pm$ 0.112 for single stars and $\alpha$ = 1.490 $\pm$ 0.051 for a binary
fraction of $\sim$ 0.558 in the mass range 1 M$_{\odot}$ $\leq$ m(M$_{\odot}$)
$\leq$ 100 M$_{\odot}$. The $G$-band luminosity function slope is estimated to
be $\sim$ 0.33 $\pm$ 0.09. We use $(J-H)$ versus $(H-K_s)$ color-color diagram
to identify young stellar objects (YSOs). We found that all the identified YSOs
have ages $\leq$ 2 Myr and masses $\sim$ 0.35 - 5.5 M$_{\odot}$. We also fit
the radial surface density profile. Using the galpy we performed orbit analysis
of the cluster. The extinction map for the cluster region has been generated
using the PNICER technique and it is almost similar to the dust structure
obtained from the 500 $\mu$$m$ dust continuum emissions map of $Herschel$
SPIRE. We finally at the end discussed the star formation scenario in the
cluster region.",2024-02-12T16:20:06Z
The Present-Day Mass Function of Star Clusters in the Solar Neighborhood,"This work analyses the present-day mass function (PDMF) of 93~star clusters
utilizing Gaia DR3 data, with membership determined by the StarGo machine
learning algorithm. The impact of unresolved binary systems on mass estimation
is rigorously assessed, adopting three mass ratio profiles for correction. The
PDMF is characterized by the power-law index, $\alpha$, derived through a
robust maximum likelihood method that avoids biases associated with data
binning. The value of $\alpha$ for stars between the completeness limited mass
of Gaia with a mean 0.3 $M_\odot$ for our cluster samples and 2 $M_\odot$,
exhibits stability for clusters younger than 200 Myr, decreasing for older
clusters, particularly when considering stars within the half-mass radius. The
PDMF of these star clusters is consistent with a dynamically evolved Kroupa IMF
via the loss of low-mass stars. Cluster morphology shows a correlation with
$\alpha$, as $\alpha$ values exhibit a decreasing trend from filamentary to
tidal-tail clusters, mirroring the sequence of increasing cluster age. The
dependence of $\alpha$ on total cluster mass is weak, with a subtle increase
for higher-mass clusters, especially outside the half-mass radius. We do not
observe a correlation between $\alpha$ and the mean metallicity of the
clusters. Younger clusters have lower metallicity compared to their older
counterparts, which indicates that the older clusters might have migrated to
the solar neighbourhood from the inner disk. A comparison with numerical models
incorporating a black hole population suggests the need for observations of
distant, older, massive open clusters to determine whether or not they contain
black holes.",2024-03-13T18:00:00Z
"Comparative study of the kinetic properties of proton and alpha beams in
  the Alfvénic wind observed by SWA-PAS onboard Solar Orbiter","The problems of heating and acceleration of solar wind particles are of
significant and enduring interest in astrophysics. The interactions between
waves and particles are crucial in determining the distributions of proton and
alpha particles, resulting in non-Maxwellian characteristics including
temperature anisotropies and particle beams. These processes can be better
understood as long as the beam can be separated from the core for the two major
components of the solar wind. We utilized an alternative numerical approach
that leverages the clustering technique employed in Machine Learning to
differentiate the primary populations within the velocity distribution, rather
than employing the conventional bi-Maxwellian fitting method. Separation of the
core and beam revealed new features for protons and alphas. We estimated that
the total temperature of the two beams was slightly higher than that of their
respective cores, and the temperature anisotropy for the cores and beams was
larger than 1. We concluded that the temperature ratio between alphas and
protons largely over 4 is due to the presence of a massive alpha beam, which is
approximately 50\% of the alpha core. We provided evidence that the alpha core
and beam populations are sensitive to Alfv\'enic fluctuations and the surfing
effect found in the literature can be recovered only when considering the core
and beam as a single population. Several similarities between proton and alpha
beams would suggest a common and local generation mechanism not shared with the
alpha core, which may not have necessarily been accelerated and heated locally.",2024-03-15T17:24:01Z
"Barium stars as tracers of s-process nucleosynthesis in AGB stars III.
  Systematic deviations from the AGB models","Barium (Ba) stars help to verify asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star
nucleosynthesis models since they experienced pollution from an AGB binary
companion and thus their spectra carry the signatures of the slow neutron
capture process (s process). For 180 Ba stars, we searched for AGB stellar
models that match the observed abundance patterns. We employed three machine
learning algorithms as classifiers: a Random Forest method, developed for this
work, and the two classifiers used in our previous study. We studied the
statistical behaviour of the s-process elements in the observational sample to
investigate if the AGB models systematically under- or overpredict the
abundances observed in the Ba stars and show the results in the form of violin
plots of the residuals between spectroscopic abundances and model predictions.
We find a significant trend in the residuals that implies an underproduction of
the elements Nb, Mo, and Ru in the models relative to the observations. This
may originate from a process (e.g. the intermediate neutron-capture process, i
process) at the metallicity of the Ba stars not yet included in the AGB models.
Correlations are found between the residuals of these elements, suggesting a
common origin for the deviations. In addition, there is a weak metallicity
dependence of their residuals. The s-process temperatures derived with the
[Zr/Fe] - [Nb/Fe] thermometer have an unrealistic value for the majority of our
stars. The most likely explanation is that at least a fraction of these
elements are not produced in a steady-state s process, and instead may be due
to processes not included in the AGB models. The mass distribution of the
identified models confirms that our sample of Ba stars was polluted by low-mass
AGB stars. Most of the matching AGB models require low accreted mass, but a few
systems with high accreted mass are needed to explain the observations.

"Towards Characterization of the Type IIP Supernova Progenitor
  Population: a Statistical Sample of Light Curves from Pan-STARRS1","In recent years, wide-field sky surveys providing deep multi-band imaging
have presented a new path for indirectly characterizing the progenitor
populations of core-collapse supernovae (SN): systematic light curve studies.
We assemble a set of 76 grizy-band Type IIP SN light curves from Pan-STARRS1,
obtained over a constant survey program of 4 years and classified using both
spectroscopy and machine learning-based photometric techniques. We develop and
apply a new Bayesian model for the full multi-band evolution of each light
curve in the sample. We find no evidence of a sub-population of fast-declining
explosions (historically referred to as ""Type IIL"" SNe). However, we identify a
highly significant relation between the plateau phase decay rate and peak
luminosity among our SNe IIP. These results argue in favor of a single
parameter, likely determined by initial stellar mass, predominantly controlling
the explosions of red supergiants. This relation could also be applied for
supernova cosmology, offering a standardizable candle good to an intrinsic
scatter of 0.2 mag. We compare each light curve to physical models from
hydrodynamic simulations to estimate progenitor initial masses and other
properties of the Pan-STARRS1 Type IIP SN sample. We show that correction of
systematic discrepancies between modeled and observed SN IIP light curve
properties and an expanded grid of progenitor properties, are needed to enable
robust progenitor inferences from multi-band light curve samples of this kind.
This work will serve as a pathfinder for photometric studies of core-collapse
SNe to be conducted through future wide field transient searches.",2014-04-08T03:59:21Z
"Results from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) Future Uses
  Session at the WISE at 5 Meeting","During the ""WISE at 5: Legacy and Prospects"" conference in Pasadena, CA --
which ran from February 10 - 12, 2015 -- attendees were invited to engage in an
interactive session exploring the future uses of the Wide-field Infrared Survey
Explorer (WISE) data. The 65 participants -- many of whom are extensive users
of the data -- brainstormed the top questions still to be answered by the
mission, as well as the complementary current and future datasets and
additional processing of WISE/NEOWISE data that would aid in addressing these
most important scientific questions. The results were mainly bifurcated between
topics related to extragalactic studies (e.g. AGN, QSOs) and substellar mass
objects. In summary, participants found that complementing WISE/NEOWISE data
with cross-correlated multiwavelength surveys (e.g. SDSS, Pan-STARRS, LSST,
Gaia, Euclid, etc.) would be highly beneficial for all future mission goals.
Moreover, developing or implementing machine-learning tools to comb through and
understand cross-correlated data was often mentioned for future uses. Finally,
attendees agreed that additional processing of the data such as co-adding WISE
and NEOWISE and extracting a multi-epoch photometric database and parallax and
proper motion catalog would greatly improve the scientific results of the most
important projects identified. In that respect, a project such as MaxWISE which
would execute the most important additional processing and extraction as well
as make the data and catalogs easily accessible via a public portal was deemed
extremely important.",2015-05-08T04:08:10Z
The GALAH Survey: Chemical Clocks,"Previous studies have found that the elemental abundances of a star correlate
directly with its age and metallicity. Using this knowledge, we derive ages for
a sample of 250,000 stars taken from GALAH DR3 using only their overall
metallicity and chemical abundances. Stellar ages are estimated via the machine
learning algorithm $XGBoost$, using main sequence turnoff stars with precise
ages as our input training set. We find that the stellar ages for the bulk of
the GALAH DR3 sample are accurate to 1-2 Gyr using this method. With these
ages, we replicate many recent results on the age-kinematic trends of the
nearby disk, including the age-velocity dispersion relationship of the solar
neighborhood and the larger global velocity dispersion relations of the disk
found using $Gaia$ and GALAH. The fact that chemical abundances alone can be
used to determine a reliable age for a star have profound implications for the
future study of the Galaxy as well as upcoming spectroscopic surveys. These
results show that the chemical abundance variation at a given birth radius is
quite small, and imply that strong chemical tagging of stars directly to birth
clusters may prove difficult with our current elemental abundance precision.
Our results highlight the need of spectroscopic surveys to deliver precision
abundances for as many nucleosynthetic production sites as possible in order to
estimate reliable ages for stars directly from their chemical abundances.
Applying the methods outlined in this paper opens a new door into studies of
the kinematic structure and evolution of the disk, as ages may potentially be
estimated for a large fraction of stars in existing spectroscopic surveys. This

allow precise constraints to be put on various kinematic processes in the disk,
such as the efficiency and timescales of radial migration.",2020-11-27T14:18:43Z
"Gaia Data Release 3: All-sky classification of 12.4 million variable
  sources into 25 classes","Gaia DR3 contains 1.8 billion sources with G-band photometry, 1.5 billion of
which with BP and RP photometry, complemented by positions on the sky,
parallax, and proper motion. The median number of field-of-view transits in the
three photometric bands is between 40 and 44 measurements per source and covers
34 months of data collection. We pursue a classification of Galactic and
extra-galactic objects that are detected as variable by Gaia across the whole
sky. Supervised machine learning (eXtreme Gradient Boosting and Random Forest)
was employed to generate multi-class, binary, and meta-classifiers that
classified variable objects with photometric time series in the G, BP, and RP
bands. Classification results comprise 12.4 million sources (selected from a
much larger set of potential variable objects) and include about 9 million
variable stars classified into 22 variability types in the Milky Way and nearby
galaxies such as the Magellanic Clouds and Andromeda, plus thousands of
supernova explosions in distant galaxies, 1 million active galactic nuclei, and
almost 2.5 million galaxies. The identification of galaxies was made possible
by the artificial variability of extended objects as detected by Gaia, so they
were published in the galaxy_candidates table of the Gaia DR3 archive, separate
from the classifications of genuine variability (in the vari_classifier_result
table). The latter contains 24 variability classes or class groups of periodic
and non-periodic variables (pulsating, eclipsing, rotating, eruptive,
cataclysmic, stochastic, and microlensing), with amplitudes from a few
milli-magnitudes to several magnitudes.",2022-11-30T18:42:03Z
Gaia Early Data Release 3: The Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars,"We produce a clean and well-characterised catalogue of objects within 100\,pc
of the Sun from the \G\ Early Data Release 3. We characterise the catalogue
through comparisons to the full data release, external catalogues, and
simulations. We carry out a first analysis of the science that is possible with
this sample to demonstrate its potential and best practices for its use.
  The selection of objects within 100\,pc from the full catalogue used selected
training sets, machine-learning procedures, astrometric quantities, and
solution quality indicators to determine a probability that the astrometric
solution is reliable. The training set construction exploited the astrometric
data, quality flags, and external photometry. For all candidates we calculated
distance posterior probability densities using Bayesian procedures and mock
catalogues to define priors. Any object with reliable astrometry and a non-zero
probability of being within 100\,pc is included in the catalogue.
  We have produced a catalogue of \NFINAL\ objects that we estimate contains at
least 92\% of stars of stellar type M9 within 100\,pc of the Sun. We estimate
that 9\% of the stars in this catalogue probably lie outside 100\,pc, but when
the distance probability function is used, a correct treatment of this
contamination is possible. We produced luminosity functions with a high
signal-to-noise ratio for the main-sequence stars, giants, and white dwarfs. We
examined in detail the Hyades cluster, the white dwarf population, and
wide-binary systems and produced candidate lists for all three samples. We
detected local manifestations of several streams, superclusters, and halo
objects, in which we identified 12 members of \G\ Enceladus. We present the
first direct parallaxes of five objects in multiple systems within 10\,pc of
the Sun.",2020-12-03T16:46:54Z
"Kinematic Evidence of an Embedded Protoplanet in HD 142666 Identified by
  Machine Learning","Observations of protoplanetary disks have shown that forming exoplanets leave
characteristic imprints on the gas and dust of the disk. In the gas, these
forming exoplanets cause deviations from Keplerian motion, which can be
detected through molecular line observations. Our previous work has shown that
machine learning can correctly determine if a planet is present in these disks.
Using our machine learning models, we identify strong, localized non-Keplerian
motion within the disk HD 142666. Subsequent hydrodynamics simulations of a
system with a 5 Jupiter-mass planet at 75 au recreates the kinematic structure.
By currently established standards in the field, we conclude that HD 142666
hosts a planet. This work represents a first step towards using machine
learning to identify previously overlooked non-Keplerian features in
protoplanetary disks.",2023-01-12T15:18:38Z
"Finding Black Holes with Black Boxes -- Using Machine Learning to
  Identify Globular Clusters with Black Hole Subsystems","Machine learning is a powerful technique, becoming increasingly popular in
astrophysics. In this paper, we apply machine learning to more than a thousand
globular cluster (GC) models simulated as part of the 'MOCCA-Survey Database I'
project in order to correlate present-day observable properties with the
presence of a subsystem of stellar mass black holes (BHs). The machine learning
model is then applied to available observed parameters for Galactic GCs to
identify which of them that are most likely to be hosting a sizeable number of
BHs and reveal insights into what properties lead to the formation of BH
subsystems. With our machine learning model, we were able to shortlist 21
Galactic GCs that are most likely to contain a BH subsystem. We show that the
clusters shortlisted by the machine learning classifier include those in which
BH candidates have been observed (M22, M10 and NGC 3201) and that our results
line up well with independent simulations and previous studies that manually
compared simulated GC models with observed properties of Galactic GCs. These
results can be useful for observers searching for elusive stellar mass BH
candidates in GCs and further our understanding of the role BHs play in GC
evolution. In addition, we have released an online tool that allows one to get
predictions from our model after they input observable properties.",2018-11-15T17:06:05Z
Machine learning in solar physics,"The application of machine learning in solar physics has the potential to
greatly enhance our understanding of the complex processes that take place in
the atmosphere of the Sun. By using techniques such as deep learning, we are
now in the position to analyze large amounts of data from solar observations
and identify patterns and trends that may not have been apparent using
traditional methods. This can help us improve our understanding of explosive
events like solar flares, which can have a strong effect on the Earth
environment. Predicting hazardous events on Earth becomes crucial for our
technological society. Machine learning can also improve our understanding of
the inner workings of the sun itself by allowing us to go deeper into the data
and to propose more complex models to explain them. Additionally, the use of
machine learning can help to automate the analysis of solar data, reducing the
need for manual labor and increasing the efficiency of research in this field.",2023-06-27T08:55:20Z

Beginning from level 1 scientific products we have processed various
instrumental corrections, downsampled to manageable spatial and temporal
resolutions, and synchronized observations spatially and temporally. We

future EVE irradiance from present EVE irradiance and translating HMI
observations into AIA observations. For each application we provide metrics and
baselines for future model comparison. We anticipate this curated dataset will
facilitate machine learning research in heliophysics and the physical sciences
generally, increasing the scientific return of the SDO mission. This work is a

"Machine Learning Solar Wind Driving Magnetospheric Convection in Tail
  Lobes","To quantitatively study the driving mechanisms of magnetospheric convection
in the magnetotail lobes on a global scale, we utilize data from the ARTEMIS
spacecraft in the deep tail and the Cluster spacecraft in the near tail.
Previous work demonstrated that, in the lobes near the Moon, we can estimate
the convection by utilizing ARTEMIS measurements of lunar ions velocity. In
this paper, we analyze these datasets with machine learning models to determine
what upstream factors drive the lobe convection in different magnetotail
regions and thereby understand the mechanisms that control the dynamics of the
tail lobes. Our results show that the correlations between the predicted and
test convection velocities for the machine learning models (>0.75) are much
better than those of the multiple linear regression model (~ 0.23 - 0.43). The
systematic analysis reveals that the IMF and magnetospheric activity play an
important role in influencing plasma convection in the global magnetotail
lobes.",2022-02-03T02:59:28Z
"Algebraic and machine learning approach to hierarchical triple-star
  stability","We present two approaches to determine the dynamical stability of a
hierarchical triple-star system. The first is an improvement on the
Mardling-Aarseth stability formula from 2001, where we introduce a dependence
on inner orbital eccentricity and improve the dependence on mutual orbital
inclination. The second involves a machine learning approach, where we use a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) to classify triple-star systems as `stable' and
`unstable'. To achieve this, we generate a large training data set of 10^6
hierarchical triples using the N-body code MSTAR. Both our approaches perform
better than previous stability criteria, with the MLP model performing the
best. The improved stability formula and the machine learning model have
overall classification accuracies of 93 % and 95 % respectively. Our MLP model,
which accurately predicts the stability of any hierarchical triple-star system
within the parameter ranges studied with almost no computation required, is
publicly available on Github in the form of an easy-to-use Python script.",2022-07-07T08:29:17Z
"Machine learning for reconstruction of polarity inversion lines from
  solar filaments","Solar filaments are well-known tracers of polarity inversion lines that
separate two opposite magnetic polarities on the solar photosphere. Because
observations of filaments began long before the systematic observations of
solar magnetic fields, historical filament catalogs can facilitate the
reconstruction of magnetic polarity maps at times when direct magnetic
observations were not yet available. In practice, this reconstruction is often
ambiguous and typically performed manually. We propose an automatic approach
based on a machine-learning model that generates a variety of magnetic polarity
maps consistent with filament observations. To evaluate the model and discuss
the results we use the catalog of solar filaments and polarity maps compiled by
McIntosh. We realize that the process of manual compilation of polarity maps
includes not only information on filaments, but also a large amount of prior
information, which is difficult to formalize. In order to compensate for the
lack of prior knowledge for the machine-learning model, we provide it with
polarity information at several reference points. We demonstrate that this
process, which can be considered as the user-guided reconstruction or
super-resolution, leads to polarity maps that are reasonably close to
hand-drawn ones, and additionally allows for uncertainty estimation.",2024-05-10T07:51:26Z
"Predicting the energetic proton flux with a machine learning regression
  algorithm","The need of real-time of monitoring and alerting systems for Space Weather
hazards has grown significantly in the last two decades. One of the most
important challenge for space mission operations and planning is the prediction
of solar proton events (SPEs). In this context, artificial intelligence and
machine learning techniques have opened a new frontier, providing a new
paradigm for statistical forecasting algorithms. The great majority of these
models aim to predict the occurrence of a SPE, i.e., they are based on the
classification approach. In this work we present a simple and efficient machine
learning regression algorithm which is able to forecast the energetic proton
flux up to 1 hour ahead by exploiting features derived from the electron flux
only. This approach could be helpful to improve monitoring systems of the
radiation risk in both deep space and near-Earth environments. The model is
very relevant for mission operations and planning, especially when flare
characteristics and source location are not available in real time, as at Mars
distance.",2024-06-18T15:54:50Z
Inferring Global Dynamics of a Black-Box System Using Machine Learning,"We present that, instead of establishing the equations of motion, one can
model-freely reveal the dynamical properties of a black-box system using a
learning machine. Trained only by a segment of time series of a state variable
recorded at present parameters values, the dynamics of the learning machine at
different training stages can be mapped to the dynamics of the target system
along a particular path in its parameter space, following an appropriate
training strategy that monotonously decreases the cost function. This path is
important, because along that, the primary dynamical properties of the target
system will subsequently emerge, in the simple-to-complex order, matching
closely the evolution law of certain self-evolved systems in nature. Why such a
path can be reproduced is attributed to our training strategy. This particular
function of the learning machine opens up a novel way to probe the global
dynamical properties of a black-box system without artificially establish the
equations of motion, and as such it might have countless applications. As an
example, this method is applied to infer what dynamical stages a variable star
has experienced and how it will evolve in future, by using the light curve
observed presently.",2019-05-10T13:31:19Z
Streaming Classification of Variable Stars,"In the last years, automatic classification of variable stars has received
substantial attention. Using machine learning techniques for this task has
proven to be quite useful. Typically, machine learning classifiers used for
this task require to have a fixed training set, and the training process is
performed offline. Upcoming surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
(LSST) will generate new observations daily, where an automatic classification
system able to create alerts online will be mandatory. A system with those
characteristics must be able to update itself incrementally. Unfortunately,
after training, most machine learning classifiers do not support the inclusion
of new observations in light curves, they need to re-train from scratch.
Naively re-training from scratch is not an option in streaming settings, mainly
because of the expensive pre-processing routines required to obtain a vector
representation of light curves (features) each time we include new
observations. In this work, we propose a streaming probabilistic classification
model; it uses a set of newly designed features that work incrementally. With
this model, we can have a machine learning classifier that updates itself in
real time with new observations. To test our approach, we simulate a streaming
scenario with light curves from CoRot, OGLE and MACHO catalogs. Results show
that our model achieves high classification performance, staying an order of
magnitude faster than traditional classification approaches.",2019-12-04T20:09:56Z
"Machine learning Applied to Star-Galaxy-QSO Classification and Stellar
  Effective Temperature Regression","In modern astrophysics, the machine learning has increasingly gained more
popularity with its incredibly powerful ability to make predictions or
calculated suggestions for large amounts of data. We describe an application of
the supervised machine-learning algorithm, random forests (RF), to the
star/galaxy/QSO classification and the stellar effective temperature regression
based on the combination of LAMOST and SDSS spectroscopic data. This
combination enable us to obtain reliable predictions with one of the largest
training sample ever used. The training samples are built with nine-color data
set of about three million objects for the classification and seven-color data
set of over one million stars for the regression. The performance of the
classification and regression is examined with the validation and the blind
tests on the objects in the RAVE, 6dFGS, UVQS and APOGEE surveys. We
demonstrate that the RF is an effective algorithm with the classification
accuracies higher than 99\% for the stars and the galaxies, and higher than
94\% for the QSOs. These accuracies are higher than the machine-learning
results in the former studies. The total standard deviations of the regression
are smaller than 200 K that is similar to those of some spectrum-based methods.
The machine-learning algorithm with the broad-band photometry provides us a
more efficient approach to deal with massive amounts of astrophysical data than
traditional color-cuts and SED fit.",2018-11-09T02:13:58Z
"Predicting binding energies of astrochemically relevant molecules via
  machine learning","The behaviour of molecules in space is to a large extent governed by where
they freeze out or sublimate. The molecular binding energy is thus an important
parameter for many astrochemical studies. This parameter is usually determined
with time-consuming experiments, computationally expensive quantum chemical
calculations, or the inexpensive, but inaccurate, linear addition method. In
this work we propose a new method based on machine learning for predicting
binding energies that is accurate, yet computationally inexpensive. A machine
learning model based on Gaussian Process Regression is created and trained on a
database of binding energies of molecules collected from laboratory experiments
presented in the literature. The molecules in the database are categorized by
their features, such as mono- or multilayer coverage, binding surface,
functional groups, valence electrons, and H-bond acceptors and donors. The
performance of the model is assessed with five-fold and leave-one-molecule-out
cross validation. Predictions are generally accurate, with differences between
predicted and literature binding energies values of less than $\pm$20\%. The
validated model is used to predict the binding energies of twenty one molecules
that have recently been detected in the interstellar medium, but for which
binding energy values are not known. A simplified model is used to visualize
where the snowlines of these molecules would be located in a protoplanetary
disk. This work demonstrates that machine learning can be employed to
accurately and rapidly predict binding energies of molecules. Machine learning
complements current laboratory experiments and quantum chemical computational
studies. The predicted binding energies will find use in the modelling of
astrochemical and planet-forming environments.",2022-07-08T13:48:46Z
"Detecting and Classifying Flares in High-Resolution Solar Spectra with
  Supervised Machine Learning","Flares are a well-studied aspect of the Sun's magnetic activity. Detecting
and classifying solar flares can inform the analysis of contamination caused by
stellar flares in exoplanet transmission spectra. In this paper, we present a
standardized procedure to classify solar flares with the aid of supervised
machine learning. Using flare data from the RHESSI mission and solar spectra
from the HARPS-N instrument, we trained several supervised machine learning
models, and found that the best performing algorithm is a C-Support Vector
Machine (SVC) with non-linear kernels, specifically Radial Basis Functions
(RBF). The best-trained model, SVC with RBF kernels, achieves an average
aggregate accuracy score of 0.65, and categorical accuracy scores of over 0.70
for the no-flare and weak-flare classes, respectively. In comparison, a blind
classification algorithm would have an accuracy score of 0.33. Testing showed
that the model is able to detect and classify solar flares in entirely new data
with different characteristics and distributions from those of the training
set. Future efforts could focus on enhancing classification accuracy,
investigating the efficacy of alternative models, particularly deep learning
models, and incorporating more datasets to extend the application of this
framework to stars that host exoplanets.",2024-06-21T18:52:03Z

"Closing the stellar labels gap: An unsupervised, generative model for
  $\textit{Gaia}$ BP/RP spectra","The recent release of 220+ million BP/RP spectra in $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3
presents an opportunity to apply deep learning models to an unprecedented
number of stellar spectra, at extremely low-resolution. The BP/RP dataset is so
massive that no previous spectroscopic survey can provide enough stellar labels
to cover the BP/RP parameter space. We present an unsupervised, deep,
generative model for BP/RP spectra: a $\textit{scatter}$ variational
auto-encoder. We design a non-traditional variational auto-encoder which is
capable of modeling both $(i)$ BP/RP coefficients and $(ii)$ intrinsic scatter.
Our model learns a latent space from which to generate BP/RP spectra (scatter)
directly from the data itself without requiring any stellar labels. We
demonstrate that our model accurately reproduces BP/RP spectra in regions of
parameter space where supervised learning fails or cannot be implemented.",2023-07-12T18:03:31Z
"A Machine Learning and Computer Vision Approach to Geomagnetic Storm
  Forecasting","Geomagnetic storms, disturbances of Earth's magnetosphere caused by masses of
charged particles being emitted from the Sun, are an uncontrollable threat to
modern technology. Notably, they have the potential to damage satellites and
cause instability in power grids on Earth, among other disasters. They result
from high sun activity, which are induced from cool areas on the Sun known as
sunspots. Forecasting the storms to prevent disasters requires an understanding
of how and when they will occur. However, current prediction methods at the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are limited in that they
depend on expensive solar wind spacecraft and a global-scale magnetometer
sensor network. In this paper, we introduce a novel machine learning and
computer vision approach to accurately forecast geomagnetic storms without the
need of such costly physical measurements. Our approach extracts features from
images of the Sun to establish correlations between sunspots and geomagnetic
storm classification and is competitive with NOAA's predictions. Indeed, our
prediction achieves a 76% storm classification accuracy. This paper serves as
an existence proof that machine learning and computer vision techniques provide
an effective means for augmenting and improving existing geomagnetic storm
forecasting methods.",2022-04-04T15:38:33Z
"Imagery Tracking of Sun Activity Using 2D Circular Kernel Time Series
  Transformation, Entropy Measures and Machine Learning Approaches","The sun is highly complex in nature and its observatory imagery features is
one of the most important sources of information about the sun activity, space
and Earth's weather conditions. The NASA, solar Dynamics Observatory captures
approximately 70,000 images of the sun activity in a day and the continuous
visual inspection of this solar observatory images is challenging. In this
study, we developed a technique of tracking the sun's activity using 2D
circular kernel time series transformation, statistical and entropy measures,
with machine learning approaches. The technique involves transforming the solar
observatory image section into 1-Dimensional time series (1-DTS) while the
statistical and entropy measures (Approach 1) and direct classification
(Approach 2) is used to capture the extraction features from the 1-DTS for
machine learning classification into 'solar storm' and 'no storm'. We found
that the potential accuracy of the model in tracking the activity of the sun is
approximately 0.981 for Approach 1 and 0.999 for Approach 2. The stability of
the developed approach to rotational transformation of the solar observatory
image is evident. When training on the original dataset for Approach 1, the
match index (T90) of the distribution of solar storm areas reaches T90 ~ 0.993,
and T90 ~ 0.951 for Approach 2. In addition, when using the extended training
base, the match indices increased to T90 ~ 0.994 and T90 ~ 1, respectively.
This model consistently classifies areas with swirling magnetic lines
associated with solar storms and is robust to image rotation, glare, and
optical artifacts.",2023-06-14T06:13:50Z
"MEMPSEP III. A machine learning-oriented multivariate data set for
  forecasting the Occurrence and Properties of Solar Energetic Particle Events
  using a Multivariate Ensemble Approach","We introduce a new multivariate data set that utilizes multiple spacecraft
collecting in-situ and remote sensing heliospheric measurements shown to be
linked to physical processes responsible for generating solar energetic
particles (SEPs). Using the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites
(GOES) flare event list from Solar Cycle (SC) 23 and part of SC 24 (1998-2013),
we identify 252 solar events (flares) that produce SEPs and 17,542 events that
do not. For each identified event, we acquire the local plasma properties at 1
au, such as energetic proton and electron data, upstream solar wind conditions,
and the interplanetary magnetic field vector quantities using various
instruments onboard GOES and the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)
spacecraft. We also collect remote sensing data from instruments onboard the
Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO), Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO), and
the Wind solar radio instrument WAVES. The data set is designed to allow for
variations of the inputs and feature sets for machine learning (ML) in
heliophysics and has a specific purpose for forecasting the occurrence of SEP
events and their subsequent properties. This paper describes a dataset created
from multiple publicly available observation sources that is validated,
cleaned, and carefully curated for our machine-learning pipeline. The dataset
has been used to drive the newly-developed Multivariate Ensemble of Models for

"Disentangling CO Chemistry in a Protoplanetary Disk Using Explanatory
  Machine Learning Techniques","Molecular abundances in protoplanetary disks are highly sensitive to the
local physical conditions, including gas temperature, gas density, radiation
field, and dust properties. Often multiple factors are intertwined, impacting
the abundances of both simple and complex species. We present a new approach to
understanding these chemical and physical interdependencies using machine
learning. Specifically we explore the case of CO modeled under the conditions
of a generic disk and build an explanatory regression model to study the
dependence of CO spatial density on the gas density, gas temperature, cosmic
ray ionization rate, X-ray ionization rate, and UV flux. Our findings indicate
that combinations of parameters play a surprisingly powerful role in regulating
CO compared to any singular physical parameter. Moreover, in general, we find
the conditions in the disk are destructive toward CO. CO depletion is further
enhanced in an increased cosmic ray environment and in disks with higher
initial C/O ratios. These dependencies uncovered by our new approach are
consistent with previous studies, which are more modeling intensive and
computationally expensive. Our work thus shows that machine learning can be a
powerful tool not only for creating efficient predictive models, but also for
enabling a deeper understanding of complex chemical processes.",2023-12-08T18:59:22Z
Machine Learning Classification of Gaia Data Release 2,"Machine learning has increasingly gained more popularity with its incredibly

Pan-STARRS 1 and AllWISE data. The classification results are cross-matched
with Simbad database, and the total accuracy is 91.9%. Our sample is dominated
by stars, $\sim$ 98%, and galaxies makes up 2%. For the objects with negative
parallaxes, about 2.5\% are galaxies and QSOs, while about 99.9% are stars if
the relative parallax uncertainties are smaller than 0.2. Our result implies

Stellar Cluster Detection using GMM with Deep Variational Autoencoder,"Detecting stellar clusters have always been an important research problem in

of star clusters even in the presence of noise and distortion.",2018-09-05T11:06:06Z
Exploring helical dynamos with machine learning,"We use ensemble machine learning algorithms to study the evolution of
magnetic fields in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence that is helically
forced. We perform direct numerical simulations of helically forced turbulence
using mean field formalism, with electromotive force (EMF) modeled both as a
linear and non-linear function of the mean magnetic field and current density.
The form of the EMF is determined using regularized linear regression and
random forests. We also compare various analytical models to the data using
Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Our results
demonstrate that linear regression is largely successful at predicting the EMF
and the use of more sophisticated algorithms (random forests, MCMC) do not lead
to significant improvement in the fits. We conclude that the data we are
looking at is effectively low dimensional and essentially linear. Finally, to
encourage further exploration by the community, we provide all of our
simulation data and analysis scripts as open source IPython notebooks.",2019-05-20T16:18:33Z

estimations of errors and uncertainties are crucial. To address this issue we
propose a Bayesian framework that decomposes uncertainties into epistemic and

given low resolution magnetogram.",2019-11-04T20:58:32Z
"Machine learning methods for the search for L&T brown dwarfs in the data
  of modern sky surveys","According to various estimates, brown dwarfs (BD) should account for up to 25
percent of all objects in the Galaxy. However, few of them are discovered and
well-studied, both individually and as a population. Homogeneous and complete
samples of brown dwarfs are needed for these kinds of studies. Due to their
weakness, spectral studies of brown dwarfs are rather laborious. For this
reason, creating a significant reliable sample of brown dwarfs, confirmed by
spectroscopic observations, seems unattainable at the moment. Numerous attempts
have been made to search for and create a set of brown dwarfs using their
colours as a decision rule applied to a vast amount of survey data. In this
work, we use machine learning methods such as Random Forest Classifier,
XGBoost, SVM Classifier and TabNet on PanStarrs DR1, 2MASS and WISE data to
distinguish L and T brown dwarfs from objects of other spectral and luminosity
classes. The explanation of the models is discussed. We also compare our models
with classical decision rules, proving their efficiency and relevance.",2023-08-06T08:14:35Z
"Transfer Learning in Spatial-Temporal Forecasting of the Solar Magnetic
  Field","Machine learning techniques have been widely used in attempts to forecast
several solar datasets. Most of these approaches employ supervised machine
learning algorithms which are, in general, very data hungry. This hampers the
attempts to forecast some of these data series, particularly the ones that
depend on (relatively) recent space observations. Here we focus on an attempt
to forecast the solar surface longitudinally averaged radial magnetic field
distribution using a form of spatial-temporal neural networks. Given that the
recording of these spatial-temporal datasets only started in 1975 and are
therefore quite short, the forecasts are predictably quite modest. However,
given that there is a potential physical relationship between sunspots and the
magnetic field, we employ another machine learning technique called transfer
learning which has recently received considerable attention in the literature.
Here, this approach consists in first training the source spatial-temporal
neural network on the much longer time/latitude sunspot area dataset, which
starts in 1874, then transferring the trained set of layers to a target
network, and continue training the latter on the magnetic field dataset. The
employment of transfer learning in the field of computer vision is known to
obtain a generalized set of feature filters that can be reused for other
datasets and tasks. Here we obtain a similar result, whereby we first train the
network on the spatial-temporal sunspot area data, then the first few layers of
the neural network are able to identify the two main features of the solar

therefore can be used to train on the magnetic field dataset and forecast
better than a prediction based only on the historical magnetic field data.",2019-11-08T11:25:37Z
"Astroconformer: Inferring Surface Gravity of Stars from Stellar Light
  Curves with Transformer","We introduce Astroconformer, a Transformer-based model to analyze stellar
light curves from the Kepler mission. We demonstrate that Astrconformer can
robustly infer the stellar surface gravity as a supervised task. Importantly,
as Transformer captures long-range information in the time series, it
outperforms the state-of-the-art data-driven method in the field, and the
critical role of self-attention is proved through ablation experiments.
Furthermore, the attention map from Astroconformer exemplifies the long-range
correlation information learned by the model, leading to a more interpretable
deep learning approach for asteroseismology. Besides data from Kepler, we also
show that the method can generalize to sparse cadence light curves from the
Rubin Observatory, paving the way for the new era of asteroseismology,
harnessing information from long-cadence ground-based observations.",2022-07-06T16:22:37Z
"O-type Stars Stellar Parameter Estimation Using Recurrent Neural
  Networks","In this paper, we present a deep learning system approach to estimating
luminosity, effective temperature, and surface gravity of O-type stars using
the optical region of the stellar spectra. In previous work, we compare a set
of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in order to establish a
reliable way to fit a stellar model using two methods: the classification of
the stellar spectra models and the estimation of the physical parameters in a
regression-type task. Here we present the process to estimate individual
physical parameters from an artificial neural network perspective with the
capacity to handle stellar spectra with a low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), in
the $<$20 S/N boundaries. The development of three different recurrent neural
network systems, the training process using stellar spectra models, the test
over nine different observed stellar spectra, and the comparison with
estimations in previous works are presented. Additionally, characterization
methods for stellar spectra in order to reduce the dimensionality of the input
data for the system and optimize the computational resources are discussed.",2022-10-23T17:18:52Z
"A comparative study of non-deep learning, deep learning, and ensemble
  learning methods for sunspot number prediction","Solar activity has significant impacts on human activities and health. One
most commonly used measure of solar activity is the sunspot number. This paper
compares three important non-deep learning models, four popular deep learning
models, and their five ensemble models in forecasting sunspot numbers. In
particular, we propose an ensemble model called XGBoost-DL, which uses XGBoost
as a two-level nonlinear ensemble method to combine the deep learning models.
Our XGBoost-DL achieves the best forecasting performance (RMSE = 25.70 and MAE
= 19.82) in the comparison, outperforming the best non-deep learning model
SARIMA (RMSE = 54.11 and MAE = 45.51), the best deep learning model Informer
(RMSE = 29.90 and MAE = 22.35) and the NASA's forecast (RMSE = 48.38 and MAE =
38.45). Our XGBoost-DL forecasts a peak sunspot number of 133.47 in May 2025
for Solar Cycle 25 and 164.62 in November 2035 for Solar Cycle 26, similar to
but later than the NASA's at 137.7 in October 2024 and 161.2 in December 2034.
An open-source Python package of our XGBoost-DL for the sunspot number
prediction is available at https://github.com/yd1008/ts_ensemble_sunspot.",2022-03-11T05:11:31Z
"Forecasting SEP Events During Solar Cycles 23 and 24 Using Interpretable
  Machine Learning","Prediction of the Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events garner increasing
interest as space missions extend beyond Earth's protective magnetosphere.
These events, which are, in most cases, products of magnetic
reconnection-driven processes during solar flares or fast
coronal-mass-ejection-driven shock waves, pose significant radiation hazards to
aviation, space-based electronics, and particularly, space exploration. In this
work, we utilize the recently developed dataset that combines the Solar
Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager's (SDO/HMI) Space weather
HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) and the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory/Michelson Doppler Imager's (SoHO/MDI) Space Weather MDI Active
Region Patches (SMARP). We employ a suite of machine learning strategies,
including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and regression models, to evaluate the
predictive potential of this new data product for a forecast of post-solar
flare SEP events. Our study indicates that despite the augmented volume of
data, the prediction accuracy reaches 0.7 +- 0.1, which aligns with but does
not exceed these published benchmarks. A linear SVM model with training and
testing configurations that mimic an operational setting (positive-negative
imbalance) reveals a slight increase (+ 0.04 +- 0.05) in the accuracy of a
14-hour SEP forecast compared to previous studies. This outcome emphasizes the
imperative for more sophisticated, physics-informed models to better understand
the underlying processes leading to SEP events.",2024-03-04T23:12:17Z
"A Machine Learning Enhanced Approach for Automated Sunquake Detection in
  Acoustic Emission Maps","Sunquakes are seismic emissions visible on the solar surface, associated with
some solar flares. Although discovered in 1998, they have only recently become
a more commonly detected phenomenon. Despite the availability of several manual
detection guidelines, to our knowledge, the astrophysical data produced for
sunquakes is new to the field of Machine Learning. Detecting sunquakes is a
daunting task for human operators and this work aims to ease and, if possible,
to improve their detection. Thus, we introduce a dataset constructed from
acoustic egression-power maps of solar active regions obtained for Solar Cycles
23 and 24 using the holography method. We then present a pedagogical approach
to the application of machine learning representation methods for sunquake
detection using AutoEncoders, Contrastive Learning, Object Detection and
recurrent techniques, which we enhance by introducing several custom
domain-specific data augmentation transformations. We address the main
challenges of the automated sunquake detection task, namely the very high noise
patterns in and outside the active region shadow and the extreme class
imbalance given by the limited number of frames that present sunquake
signatures. With our trained models, we find temporal and spatial locations of
peculiar acoustic emission and qualitatively associate them to eruptive and
high energy emission. While noting that these models are still in a prototype
stage and there is much room for improvement in metrics and bias levels, we
hypothesize that their agreement on example use cases has the potential to
enable detection of weak solar acoustic manifestations.",2022-12-13T16:42:20Z
Ensemble Learning for CME Arrival Time Prediction,"The Sun constantly releases radiation and plasma into the heliosphere.
Sporadically, the Sun launches solar eruptions such as flares and coronal mass
ejections (CMEs). CMEs carry away a huge amount of mass and magnetic flux with
them. An Earth-directed CME can cause serious consequences to the human system.
It can destroy power grids/pipelines, satellites, and communications.
Therefore, accurately monitoring and predicting CMEs is important to minimize
damages to the human system. In this study we propose an ensemble learning
approach, named CMETNet, for predicting the arrival time of CMEs from the Sun
to the Earth. We collect and integrate eruptive events from two solar cycles,
#23 and #24, from 1996 to 2021 with a total of 363 geoeffective CMEs. The data
used for making predictions include CME features, solar wind parameters and CME
images obtained from the SOHO/LASCO C2 coronagraph. Our ensemble learning
framework comprises regression algorithms for numerical data analysis and a
convolutional neural network for image processing. Experimental results show
that CMETNet performs better than existing machine learning methods reported in
the literature, with a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient of 0.83
and a mean absolute error of 9.75 hours.",2023-04-29T13:35:43Z
The Scaling Law in Stellar Light Curves,"Analyzing time series of fluxes from stars, known as stellar light curves,
can reveal valuable information about stellar properties. However, most current
methods rely on extracting summary statistics, and studies using deep learning
have been limited to supervised approaches. In this research, we investigate
the scaling law properties that emerge when learning from astronomical time
series data using self-supervised techniques. By employing the GPT-2
architecture, we show the learned representation improves as the number of
parameters increases from $10^4$ to $10^9$, with no signs of performance
plateauing. We demonstrate that a self-supervised Transformer model achieves
3-10 times the sample efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art supervised
learning model when inferring the surface gravity of stars as a downstream
task. Our research lays the groundwork for analyzing stellar light curves by
examining them through large-scale auto-regressive generative models.",2024-05-27T13:31:03Z
"Global Earth Magnetic Field Modeling and Forecasting with Spherical
  Harmonics Decomposition","Modeling and forecasting the solar wind-driven global magnetic field
perturbations is an open challenge. Current approaches depend on simulations of
computationally demanding models like the Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model or
sampling spatially and temporally through sparse ground-based stations
(SuperMAG). In this paper, we develop a Deep Learning model that forecasts in
Spherical Harmonics space 2, replacing reliance on MHD models and providing
global coverage at one minute cadence, improving over the current
state-of-the-art which relies on feature engineering. We evaluate the
performance in SuperMAG dataset (improved by 14.53%) and MHD simulations
(improved by 24.35%). Additionally, we evaluate the extrapolation performance
of the spherical harmonics reconstruction based on sparse ground-based stations
(SuperMAG), showing that spherical harmonics can reliably reconstruct the
global magnetic field as evaluated on MHD simulation.",2021-02-02T11:47:07Z
"Predictions of nuclear $β$-decay half-lives with machine learning
  and their impacts on $r$ process","Nuclear $\beta$ decay is a key process to understand the origin of heavy
elements in the universe, while the accuracy is far from satisfactory for the
predictions of $\beta$-decay half-lives by nuclear models up to date. In this
letter, we pave a novel way to accurately predict $\beta$-decay half-lives with
the machine-learning based on the Bayesian neural network, in which the known
physics has been explicitly embedded, including the ones described by the Fermi
theory of $\beta$ decay, and the dependence of half-lives on pairing
correlations and decay energies. The other potential physics, which is not
clear or even missing in nuclear models nowadays, will be learned by the
Bayesian neural network. The results well reproduce the experimental data with
a very high accuracy and further provide reasonable uncertainty evaluations in
half-life predictions. These accurate predictions for half-lives with
uncertainties are essential for the $r$-process simulations.",2018-10-07T14:42:43Z
"Feature Selection for Better Spectral Characterization or: How I Learned
  to Start Worrying and Love Ensembles","An ever-looming threat to astronomical applications of machine learning is
the danger of over-fitting data, also known as the `curse of dimensionality.'
This occurs when there are fewer samples than the number of independent
variables. In this work, we focus on the problem of stellar parameterization
from low-mid resolution spectra, with blended absorption lines. We address this
problem using an iterative algorithm to sequentially prune redundant features
from synthetic PHOENIX spectra, and arrive at an optimal set of wavelengths
with the strongest correlation with each of the output variables -- T$_{\rm
eff}$, $\log g$, and [Fe/H]. We find that at any given resolution, most
features (i.e., absorption lines) are not only redundant, but actually act as
noise and decrease the accuracy of parameter retrieval.",2019-02-19T19:00:00Z
"Nuclear mass predictions with machine learning reaching the accuracy
  required by $r$-process studies","Nuclear masses are predicted with the Bayesian neural networks by learning
the mass surface of even-even nuclei and the correlation energies to their
neighbouring nuclei. By keeping the known physics in various sophisticated mass
models and performing the delicate design of neural networks, the proposed
Bayesian machine learning (BML) mass model achieves an accuracy of $84$~keV,
which crosses the accuracy threshold of the $100$~keV in the experimentally
known region. It is also demonstrated the corresponding uncertainties of mass
predictions are properly evaluated, while the uncertainties increase by about
$50$~keV each step along the isotopic chains towards the unknown region. The
shell structures in the known region are well described and several important
features in the unknown region are predicted, such as the new magic numbers
around $N = 40$, the robustness of $N = 82$ shell, the quenching of $N = 126$
shell, and the smooth separation energies around $N = 104$.",2022-08-09T13:57:06Z
"Class-Based Time Series Data Augmentation to Mitigate Extreme Class
  Imbalance for Solar Flare Prediction","Time series data plays a crucial role across various domains, making it
valuable for decision-making and predictive modeling. Machine learning (ML) and
deep learning (DL) have shown promise in this regard, yet their performance
hinges on data quality and quantity, often constrained by data scarcity and
class imbalance, particularly for rare events like solar flares. Data
augmentation techniques offer a potential solution to address these challenges,
yet their effectiveness on multivariate time series datasets remains
underexplored. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method for
time series data named Mean Gaussian Noise (MGN). We investigate the
performance of MGN compared to eight existing basic data augmentation methods
on a multivariate time series dataset for solar flare prediction, SWAN-SF,
using a ML algorithm for time series data, TimeSeriesSVC. The results
demonstrate the efficacy of MGN and highlight its potential for improving
classification performance in scenarios with extremely imbalanced data. Our
time complexity analysis shows that MGN also has a competitive computational
cost compared to the investigated alternative methods.",2024-05-31T03:03:19Z
Exploring Coronal Heating Using Unsupervised Machine-Learning,"The perplexing mystery of what maintains the solar coronal temperature at
about a million K, while the visible disc of the Sun is only at 5800 K, has
been a long standing problem in solar physics. A recent study by Mondal(2020)
has provided the first evidence for the presence of numerous ubiquitous
impulsive emissions at low radio frequencies from the quiet sun regions, which
could hold the key to solving this mystery. These features occur at rates of
about five hundred events per minute, and their strength is only a few percent
of the background steady emission. One of the next steps for exploring the
feasibility of this resolution to the coronal heating problem is to understand
the morphology of these emissions. To meet this objective we have developed a
technique based on an unsupervised machine learning approach for characterising
the morphology of these impulsive emissions. Here we present the results of
application of this technique to over 8000 images spanning 70 minutes of data
in which about 34,500 features could robustly be characterised as 2D elliptical
Gaussians.",2021-03-09T11:39:00Z
Analyzing Astronomical Data with Machine Learning Techniques,"Classification is a popular task in the field of Machine Learning (ML) and
Artificial Intelligence (AI), and it happens when outputs are categorical
variables. There are a wide variety of models that attempts to draw some
conclusions from observed values, so classification algorithms predict
categorical class labels and use them in classifying new data. Popular
classification models including logistic regression, decision tree, random
forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron, Naive Bayes, and
neural networks have proven to be efficient and accurate applied to many
industrial and scientific problems. Particularly, the application of ML to
astronomy has shown to be very useful for classification, clustering, and data
cleaning. It is because after learning computers, these tasks can be done
automatically by them in a more precise and more rapid way than human
operators. In view of this, in this paper, we will review some of these popular
classification algorithms, and then we apply some of them to the observational
data of nonvariable and the RR Lyrae variable stars that come from the SDSS
survey. For the sake of comparison, we calculate the accuracy and F1-score of
the applied models.",2023-02-22T11:15:31Z
Quadtree features for machine learning on CMDs,"The upcoming facilities like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will provide
extremely deep photometry of thousands of star clusters to the edge of the
Galaxy and beyond, which will require adequate tools for automatic analysis,
capable of performing tasks such as the characterization of a star cluster
through the analysis of color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). The latter are
essentially point clouds in N-dimensional space, with the number of dimensions
corresponding to the photometric bands employed. In this context, machine
learning techniques suitable for tabular data are not immediately applicable to
CMDs because the number of stars included in a given CMD is variable, and
equivariance for permutations is required. To address this issue without
introducing ad-hoc manipulations that would require human oversight, here we
present a new CMD featurization procedure that summarizes a CMD by means of a
quadtree-like structure through iterative partitions of the color-magnitude
plane, extracting a fixed number of meaningful features of the relevant
subregion from any given CMD. The present approach is robust to photometric
noise and contamination and it shows that a simple linear regression on our
features predicts distance modulus (metallicity) with a scatter of 0.33 dex
(0.16 dex) in cross-validation.",2023-06-27T14:08:28Z
"A Novel Application of Conditional Normalizing Flows: Stellar Age
  Inference with Gyrochronology","Stellar ages are critical building blocks of evolutionary models, but
challenging to measure for low mass main sequence stars. An unexplored solution
in this regime is the application of probabilistic machine learning methods to
gyrochronology, a stellar dating technique that is uniquely well suited for
these stars. While accurate analytical gyrochronological models have proven
challenging to develop, here we apply conditional normalizing flows to
photometric data from open star clusters, and demonstrate that a data-driven
approach can constrain gyrochronological ages with a precision comparable to
other standard techniques. We evaluate the flow results in the context of a
Bayesian framework, and show that our inferred ages recover literature values
well. This work demonstrates the potential of a probabilistic data-driven
solution to widen the applicability of gyrochronological stellar dating.",2023-07-17T18:00:19Z
SPT: Spectral Transformer for Red Giant Stars Age and Mass Estimation,"The age and mass of red giants are essential for understanding the structure
and evolution of the Milky Way. Traditional isochrone methods for these
estimations are inherently limited due to overlapping isochrones in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, while asteroseismology, though more precise,
requires high-precision, long-term observations. In response to these
challenges, we developed a novel framework, Spectral Transformer (SPT), to
predict the age and mass of red giants aligned with asteroseismology from their
spectra. A key component of SPT, the Multi-head Hadamard Self-Attention
mechanism, designed specifically for spectra, can capture complex relationships
across different wavelength. Further, we introduced a Mahalanobis
distance-based loss function to address scale imbalance and interaction mode
loss, and incorporated Monte Carlo dropout for quantitative analysis of
prediction uncertainty.Trained and tested on 3,880 red giant spectra from
LAMOST, the SPT achieved remarkable age and mass estimations with average
percentage errors of 17.64% and 6.61%, respectively, and provided uncertainties
for each corresponding prediction. The results significantly outperform those
of traditional machine learning algorithms and demonstrate a high level of
consistency with asteroseismology methods and isochrone fitting techniques. In
the future, our work will leverage datasets from the Chinese Space Station
Telescope and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope to enhance the precision of
the model and broaden its applicability in the field of astronomy and
astrophysics.",2024-01-10T03:03:12Z
"Inferring Stellar Parameters from Iodine-Imprinted Keck/HIRES Spectra
  with Machine Learning","The properties of exoplanet host stars are traditionally characterized
through a detailed forward-modeling analysis of high-resolution spectra.
However, many exoplanet radial velocity surveys employ iodine-cell-calibrated
spectrographs, such that the vast majority of spectra obtained include an
imprinted forest of iodine absorption lines. For surveys that use iodine cells,
iodine-free ""template"" spectra must be separately obtained for precise stellar
characterization. These template spectra often require extensive additional
observing time to obtain, and they are not always feasible to obtain for faint
stars. In this paper, we demonstrate that machine learning methods can be
applied to infer stellar parameters and chemical abundances from
iodine-imprinted spectra with high accuracy and precision. The methods
presented in this work are broadly applicable to any iodine-cell-calibrated
spectrograph. We make publicly available our spectroscopic pipeline, the Cannon
HIRES Iodine Pipeline (CHIP), which derives stellar parameters and 15 chemical
abundances from iodine-imprinted spectra of FGK stars and which has been set up
for ease of use with Keck/HIRES spectra. Our proof-of-concept offers an
efficient new avenue to rapidly estimate a large number of stellar parameters
even in the absence of an iodine-free template spectrum.",2024-01-12T19:00:00Z
"Hunting for Polluted White Dwarfs and Other Treasures with Gaia XP
  Spectra and Unsupervised Machine Learning","White dwarfs (WDs) polluted by exoplanetary material provide the
unprecedented opportunity to directly observe the interiors of exoplanets.
However, spectroscopic surveys are often limited by brightness constraints, and
WDs tend to be very faint, making detections of large populations of polluted
WDs difficult. In this paper, we aim to increase considerably the number of WDs
with multiple metals in their atmospheres. Using 96,134 WDs with Gaia DR3 BP/RP
(XP) spectra, we constructed a 2D map using an unsupervised machine learning
technique called Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to
organize the WDs into identifiable spectral regions. The polluted WDs are among
the distinct spectral groups identified in our map. We have shown that this
selection method could potentially increase the number of known WDs with 5 or
more metal species in their atmospheres by an order of magnitude. Such systems
are essential for characterizing exoplanet diversity and geology.",2024-05-27T21:44:14Z
"Automatic Catalog of RRLyrae from $\sim$ 14 million VVV Light Curves:
  How far can we go with traditional machine-learning?","The creation of a 3D map of the bulge using RRLyrae (RRL) is one of the main
goals of the VVV(X) surveys. The overwhelming number of sources under analysis
request the use of automatic procedures. In this context, previous works
introduced the use of Machine Learning (ML) methods for the variable star
classification. Our goal is the development and analysis of an automatic
procedure, based on ML, for the identification of RRLs in the VVV Survey. This
procedure will be use to generate reliable catalogs integrated over several
tiles in the survey. After the reconstruction of light-curves, we extract a set
of period and intensity-based features. We use for the first time a new subset
of pseudo color features. We discuss all the appropriate steps needed to define
our automatic pipeline: selection of quality measures; sampling procedures;
classifier setup and model selection. As final result, we construct an ensemble
classifier with an average Recall of 0.48 and average Precision of 0.86 over 15
tiles. We also make available our processed datasets and a catalog of candidate
RRLs. Perhaps most interestingly, from a classification perspective based on
photometric broad-band data, is that our results indicate that Color is an
informative feature type of the RRL that should be considered for automatic
classification methods via ML. We also argue that Recall and Precision in both
tables and curves are high quality metrics for this highly imbalanced problem.
Furthermore, we show for our VVV data-set that to have good estimates it is
important to use the original distribution more than reduced samples with an
artificial balance. Finally, we show that the use of ensemble classifiers helps
resolve the crucial model selection step, and that most errors in the
identification of RRLs are related to low quality observations of some sources
or to the difficulty to resolve the RRL-C type given the date.",2020-05-01T04:35:57Z
"Classifying binary black holes from Population III stars with the
  Einstein Telescope: a machine-learning approach","Third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors like the Einstein
Telescope (ET) will observe binary black hole (BBH) mergers at redshifts up to
$z\sim 100$. However, unequivocal determination of the origin of high-redshift
sources will remain uncertain, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
poor estimate of their luminosity distance. This study proposes a machine
learning approach to infer the origins of high-redshift BBHs, specifically
differentiating those arising from Population III (Pop. III) stars - likely the
first progenitors of stellar-born BBH mergers in the Universe - and those
originated from Population I-II (Pop. I-II) stars. We have considered a wide
range of state-of-the-art models encompassing current uncertainties on Pop. III
BBH mergers. We then estimate parameter errors of detected sources with ET
using the Fisher-information-matrix formalism, followed by classification using
XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm based on decision trees. For a set of
mock observed BBHs, we provide the probability that they belong to the Pop. III
class while considering the parameter errors of each source. In our fiducial
model, we accurately identify ~10% of detected BBHs originating from Pop. III
stars with > 90% precision. Our study demonstrates how machine learning enables
to achieve some pivotal aspects of ET science case by exploring the origin of
individual high-redshift GW observations. We set the basis for further studies,
which will integrate additional simulated populations and account for
population modeling uncertainties",2024-04-15T18:00:05Z
"Astroconformer: The Prospects of Analyzing Stellar Light Curves with
  Transformer-Based Deep Learning Models","Stellar light curves contain valuable information about oscillations and
granulation, offering insights into stars' internal structures and evolutionary
states. Traditional asteroseismic techniques, primarily focused on power
spectral analysis, often overlook the crucial phase information in these light
curves. Addressing this gap, recent machine learning applications, particularly
those using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have made strides in
inferring stellar properties from light curves. However, CNNs are limited by
their localized feature extraction capabilities. In response, we introduce
$\textit{Astroconformer}$, a Transformer-based deep learning framework,
specifically designed to capture long-range dependencies in stellar light
curves. Our empirical analysis centers on estimating surface gravity ($\log
g$), using a dataset derived from single-quarter Kepler light curves with $\log
g$ values ranging from 0.2 to 4.4. $\textit{Astroconformer}$ demonstrates
superior performance, achieving a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.017 dex at
$\log g\approx3$ in data-rich regimes and up to 0.1 dex in sparser areas. This
performance surpasses both K-nearest neighbor models and advanced CNNs.
Ablation studies highlight the influence of receptive field size on model
effectiveness, with larger fields correlating to improved results.
$\textit{Astroconformer}$ also excels in extracting $\nu_{\max}$ with high
precision. It achieves less than 2% relative median absolute error for 90-day
red giant light curves. Notably, the error remains under 3% for 30-day light
curves, whose oscillations are undetectable by a conventional pipeline in 30%
cases. Furthermore, the attention mechanisms in $\textit{Astroconformer}$ align
closely with the characteristics of stellar oscillations and granulation
observed in light curves.",2023-09-28T10:13:23Z
"Active Region-based Flare Forecasting with Sliding Window Multivariate
  Time Series Forest Classifiers","Over the past few decades, many applications of physics-based simulations and
data-driven techniques (including machine learning and deep learning) have
emerged to analyze and predict solar flares. These approaches are pivotal in
understanding the dynamics of solar flares, primarily aiming to forecast these
events and minimize potential risks they may pose to Earth. Although current
methods have made significant progress, there are still limitations to these
data-driven approaches. One prominent drawback is the lack of consideration for
the temporal evolution characteristics in the active regions from which these
flares originate. This oversight hinders the ability of these methods to grasp
the relationships between high-dimensional active region features, thereby
limiting their usability in operations. This study centers on the development
of interpretable classifiers for multivariate time series and the demonstration
of a novel feature ranking method with sliding window-based sub-interval
ranking. The primary contribution of our work is to bridge the gap between
complex, less understandable black-box models used for high-dimensional data
and the exploration of relevant sub-intervals from multivariate time series,
specifically in the context of solar flare forecasting. Our findings
demonstrate that our sliding-window time series forest classifier performs
effectively in solar flare prediction (with a True Skill Statistic of over
85\%) while also pinpointing the most crucial features and sub-intervals for a
given learning task.",2024-02-05T19:34:12Z
"deep-REMAP: Parameterization of Stellar Spectra Using Regularized
  Multi-Task Learning","Traditional spectral analysis methods are increasingly challenged by the
exploding volumes of data produced by contemporary astronomical surveys. In
response, we develop deep-Regularized Ensemble-based Multi-task Learning with
Asymmetric Loss for Probabilistic Inference ($\rm{deep-REMAP}$), a novel
framework that utilizes the rich synthetic spectra from the PHOENIX library and
observational data from the MARVELS survey to accurately predict stellar
atmospheric parameters. By harnessing advanced machine learning techniques,
including multi-task learning and an innovative asymmetric loss function,
$\rm{deep-REMAP}$ demonstrates superior predictive capabilities in determining
effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity from observed spectra.
Our results reveal the framework's effectiveness in extending to other stellar
libraries and properties, paving the way for more sophisticated and automated
techniques in stellar characterization.",2023-11-07T05:41:48Z
"Unveiling the Potential of Deep Learning Models for Solar Flare
  Prediction in Near-Limb Regions","This study aims to evaluate the performance of deep learning models in
predicting $\geq$M-class solar flares with a prediction window of 24 hours,
using hourly sampled full-disk line-of-sight (LoS) magnetogram images,
particularly focusing on the often overlooked flare events corresponding to the
near-limb regions (beyond $\pm$70$^{\circ}$ of the solar disk). We trained
three well-known deep learning architectures--AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet34
using transfer learning and compared and evaluated the overall performance of
our models using true skill statistics (TSS) and Heidke skill score (HSS) and
computed recall scores to understand the prediction sensitivity in central and
near-limb regions for both X- and M-class flares. The following points
summarize the key findings of our study: (1) The highest overall performance
was observed with the AlexNet-based model, which achieved an average
TSS$\sim$0.53 and HSS$\sim$0.37; (2) Further, a spatial analysis of recall
scores disclosed that for the near-limb events, the VGG16- and ResNet34-based
models exhibited superior prediction sensitivity. The best results, however,
were seen with the ResNet34-based model for the near-limb flares, where the
average recall was approximately 0.59 (the recall for X- and M-class was 0.81
and 0.56 respectively) and (3) Our research findings demonstrate that our
models are capable of discerning complex spatial patterns from full-disk
magnetograms and exhibit skill in predicting solar flares, even in the vicinity
of near-limb regions. This ability holds substantial importance for operational
flare forecasting systems.",2023-09-25T19:30:02Z
Interpreting Stellar Spectra with Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"We discuss how to achieve mapping from large sets of imperfect simulations
and observational data with unsupervised domain adaptation. Under the
hypothesis that simulated and observed data distributions share a common
underlying representation, we show how it is possible to transfer between
simulated and observed domains. Driven by an application to interpret stellar
spectroscopic sky surveys, we construct the domain transfer pipeline from two
adversarial autoencoders on each domains with a disentangling latent space, and
a cycle-consistency constraint. We then construct a differentiable pipeline
from physical stellar parameters to realistic observed spectra, aided by a

exemplify the potential of the method on the reconstructed spectra quality and
to discover new spectral features associated to elemental abundances.",2020-07-06T23:09:13Z
"Machine-learning prediction of infrared spectra of interstellar
  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","We design and train a neural network (NN) model to efficiently predict the
infrared spectra of interstellar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with a
computational cost many orders of magnitude lower than what a first-principles
calculation would demand. The input to the NN is based on the Morgan
fingerprints extracted from the skeletal formulas of the molecules and does not
require precise geometrical information such as interatomic distances. The
model shows excellent predictive skill for out-of-sample inputs, making it
suitable for improving the mixture models currently used for understanding the
chemical composition and evolution of the interstellar medium. We also identify
the constraints to its applicability caused by the limited diversity of the
training data and estimate the prediction errors using a ensemble of NNs
trained on subsets of the data. With help from other machine-learning methods
like random forests, we dissect the role of different chemical features in this
prediction. The power of these topological descriptors is demonstrated by the
limited effect of including detailed geometrical information in the form of
Coulomb matrix eigenvalues.",2020-10-19T00:27:12Z
Machine learning-accelerated chemistry modeling of protoplanetary disks,"Aims. With the large amount of molecular emission data from (sub)millimeter
observatories and incoming James Webb Space Telescope infrared spectroscopy,
access to fast forward models of the chemical composition of protoplanetary
disks is of paramount importance.
  Methods. We used a thermo-chemical modeling code to generate a diverse
population of protoplanetary disk models. We trained a K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) regressor to instantly predict the chemistry of other disk models.
  Results. We show that it is possible to accurately reproduce chemistry using
just a small subset of physical conditions, thanks to correlations between the
local physical conditions in adopted protoplanetary disk models. We discuss the
uncertainties and limitations of this method.
  Conclusions. The proposed method can be used for Bayesian fitting of the line
emission data to retrieve disk properties from observations. We present a
pipeline for reproducing the same approach on other disk chemical model sets.",2022-09-27T12:42:13Z
Machine Learning the Tip of the Red Giant Branch,"A novel method for investigating the sensitivity of the tip of the red giant
branch (TRGB) I band magnitude $M_I$ to stellar input physics is presented. We
compute a grid of $\sim$125,000 theoretical stellar models with varying mass,
initial helium abundance, and initial metallicity, and train a machine learning
emulator to predict $M_I$ as a function of these parameters. First, our
emulator can be used to theoretically predict $M_I$ in a given galaxy using
Monte Carlo sampling. As an example, we predict $M_I = -3.84^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$
in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Second, our emulator enables a direct comparison
of theoretical predictions for $M_I$ with empirical calibrations to constrain
stellar modeling parameters using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We
demonstrate this by using empirical TRGB calibrations to obtain new independent
measurements of the metallicity in three galaxies. We find
$Z=0.0117^{+0.0083}_{-0.0055}$ in the Large Magellanic Cloud,
$Z=0.0077^{+0.0074}_{-0.0038}$ in NGC 4258, and $Z=0.0111^{+0.0083}_{-00.0056}$
in $\omega$-Centauri, consistent with other measurements. Other potential
applications of our methodology are discussed.",2023-03-21T17:57:36Z
"Solar Active Region Magnetogram Image Dataset for Studies of Space
  Weather","In this dataset we provide a comprehensive collection of magnetograms (images
quantifying the strength of the magnetic field) from the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration's (NASA's) Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The
dataset incorporates data from three sources and provides SDO Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetograms of solar active regions (regions of large
magnetic flux, generally the source of eruptive events) as well as labels of
corresponding flaring activity. This dataset will be useful for image analysis
or solar physics research related to magnetic structure, its evolution over
time, and its relation to solar flares. The dataset will be of interest to
those researchers investigating automated solar flare prediction methods,
including supervised and unsupervised machine learning (classical and deep),
binary and multi-class classification, and regression. This dataset is a
minimally processed, user configurable dataset of consistently sized images of
solar active regions that can serve as a benchmark dataset for solar flare
prediction research.",2023-05-16T14:44:24Z
"Physics-driven machine learning for the prediction of coronal mass
  ejections' travel times","Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) correspond to dramatic expulsions of plasma and
magnetic field from the solar corona into the heliosphere. CMEs are
scientifically relevant because they are involved in the physical mechanisms
characterizing the active Sun. However, more recently CMEs have attracted
attention for their impact on space weather, as they are correlated to
geomagnetic storms and may induce the generation of Solar Energetic Particles
streams. In this space weather framework, the present paper introduces a
physics-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approach to the prediction of CMEs
travel time, in which the deterministic drag-based model is exploited to
improve the training phase of a cascade of two neural networks fed with both
remote sensing and in-situ data. This study shows that the use of physical
information in the AI architecture significantly improves both the accuracy and
the robustness of the travel time prediction.",2023-05-17T08:53:29Z
"Machine-learning identified molecular fragments responsible for infrared
  emission features of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","Machine learning feature importance calculations are used to determine the
molecular substructures that are responsible for mid and far-infrared (IR)
emission features of neutral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Using the
extended-connectivity fingerprint as a descriptor of chemical structure, a
random forest model is trained on the spectra of 14,124 PAHs to evaluate the
importance of 10,632 molecular fragments for each band within the range of
2.761 to 1172.745 microns. The accuracy of the results is confirmed by
comparing them with previously studied unidentified infrared emission (UIE)
bands. The results are summarized in two tables available as Supplementary
Data, which can be used as a reference for assessing possible UIE carriers. We
demonstrate that the tables can be used to explore the relation between the PAH
structure and the spectra by discussing about the IR features of
nitrogen-containing PAHs and super-hydrogenated PAHs.",2023-07-17T06:57:42Z
Probabilistic solar flare forecasting using historical magnetogram data,"Solar flare forecasting research using machine learning (ML) has focused on
high resolution magnetogram data from the SDO/HMI era covering Solar Cycle 24
and the start of Solar Cycle 25, with some efforts looking back to SOHO/MDI for
data from Solar Cycle 23. In this paper, we consider over 4 solar cycles of
daily historical magnetogram data from multiple instruments. This is the first
attempt to take advantage of this historical data for ML-based flare
forecasting. We apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features
from full-disk magnetograms together with a logistic regression model to
incorporate scalar features based on magnetograms and flaring history. We use
an ensemble approach to generate calibrated probabilistic forecasts of M-class
or larger flares in the next 24 hours. Overall, we find that including
historical data improves forecasting skill and reliability. We show that single
frame magnetograms do not contain significantly more relevant information than
can be summarized in a small number of scalar features, and that flaring
history has greater predictive power than our CNN-extracted features. This
indicates the importance of including temporal information in flare forecasting
models.",2023-08-29T16:10:20Z
MACE: A Machine learning Approach to Chemistry Emulation,"The chemistry of an astrophysical environment is closely coupled to its
dynamics, the latter often found to be complex. Hence, to properly model these
environments a 3D context is necessary. However, solving chemical kinetics
within a 3D hydro simulation is computationally infeasible for a even a modest
parameter study. In order to develop a feasible 3D hydro-chemical simulation,
the classical chemical approach needs to be replaced by a faster alternative.
We present mace, a Machine learning Approach to Chemistry Emulation, as a
proof-of-concept work on emulating chemistry in a dynamical environment. Using
the context of AGB outflows, we have developed an architecture that combines
the use of an autoencoder (to reduce the dimensionality of the chemical
network) and a set of latent ordinary differential equations (that are solved
to perform the temporal evolution of the reduced features). Training this
architecture with an integrated scheme makes it possible to successfully
reproduce a full chemical pathway in a dynamical environment. mace outperforms
its classical analogue on average by a factor 26. Furthermore, its efficient
implementation in PyTorch results in a sub-linear scaling with respect to the
number of hydrodynamical simulation particles.",2024-05-06T08:44:38Z
"Automatic classification of plasma regions in near-Earth space with
  supervised machine learning: application to Magnetospheric Multi Scale
  2016-2019 observations","The proper classification of plasma regions in near-Earth space is crucial to
perform unambiguous statistical studies of fundamental plasma processes such as
shocks, magnetic reconnection, waves and turbulence, jets and their
combinations. The majority of available studies have been performed by using
human-driven methods, such as visual data selection or the application of
predefined thresholds to different observable plasma quantities. While
human-driven methods have allowed performing many statistical studies, these
methods are often time-consuming and can introduce important biases. On the
other hand, the recent availability of large, high-quality spacecraft
databases, together with major advances in machine-learning algorithms, can now
allow meaningful applications of machine learning to in-situ plasma data. In
this study, we apply the fully convolutional neural network (FCN) deep
machine-leaning algorithm to the recent Magnetospheric Multi Scale (MMS)
mission data in order to classify ten key plasma regions in near-Earth space
for the period 2016-2019. For this purpose, we use available intervals of time
series for each such plasma region, which were labeled by using human-driven
selective downlink applied to MMS burst data. We discuss several quantitative
parameters to assess the accuracy of both methods. Our results indicate that
the FCN method is reliable to accurately classify labeled time series data
since it takes into account the dynamical features of the plasma data in each
region. We also present good accuracy of the FCN method when applied to
unlabeled MMS data. Finally, we show how this method used on MMS data can be
extended to data from the Cluster mission, indicating that such method can be
successfully applied to any in situ spacecraft plasma database.",2020-09-01T16:54:07Z
"Identifying Exoplanets with Deep Learning. IV. Removing Stellar Activity
  Signals from Radial Velocity Measurements Using Neural Networks","Exoplanet detection with precise radial velocity (RV) observations is
currently limited by spurious RV signals introduced by stellar activity. We
show that machine learning techniques such as linear regression and neural
networks can effectively remove the activity signals (due to starspots/faculae)
from RV observations. Previous efforts focused on carefully filtering out
activity signals in time using modeling techniques like Gaussian Process
regression (e.g. Haywood et al. 2014). Instead, we systematically remove
activity signals using only changes to the average shape of spectral lines, and
no information about when the observations were collected. We trained our
machine learning models on both simulated data (generated with the SOAP 2.0
software; Dumusque et al. 2014) and observations of the Sun from the HARPS-N
Solar Telescope (Dumusque et al. 2015; Phillips et al. 2016; Collier Cameron et
al. 2019). We find that these techniques can predict and remove stellar
activity from both simulated data (improving RV scatter from 82 cm/s to 3 cm/s)
and from more than 600 real observations taken nearly daily over three years
with the HARPS-N Solar Telescope (improving the RV scatter from 1.753 m/s to
1.039 m/s, a factor of ~ 1.7 improvement). In the future, these or similar
techniques could remove activity signals from observations of stars outside our
solar system and eventually help detect habitable-zone Earth-mass exoplanets
around Sun-like stars.",2020-10-30T18:00:00Z
"cecilia: A Machine Learning-Based Pipeline for Measuring Metal
  Abundances of Helium-rich Polluted White Dwarfs","Over the past several decades, conventional spectral analysis techniques of
polluted white dwarfs have become powerful tools to learn about the geology and
chemistry of extrasolar bodies. Despite their proven capabilities and extensive
legacy of scientific discoveries, these techniques are however still limited by
their manual, time-intensive, and iterative nature. As a result, they are
susceptible to human errors and are difficult to scale up to population-wide
studies of metal pollution. This paper seeks to address this problem by
presenting cecilia, the first Machine Learning (ML)-powered spectral modeling
code designed to measure the metal abundances of intermediate-temperature
(10,000$\leq T_{\rm eff} \leq$20,000 K), Helium-rich polluted white dwarfs.
Trained with more than 22,000 randomly drawn atmosphere models and stellar
parameters, our pipeline aims to overcome the limitations of classical methods
by replacing the generation of synthetic spectra from computationally expensive
codes and uniformly spaced model grids, with a fast, automated, and efficient
neural-network-based interpolator. More specifically, cecilia combines
state-of-the-art atmosphere models, powerful artificial intelligence tools, and
robust statistical techniques to rapidly generate synthetic spectra of polluted
white dwarfs in high-dimensional space, and enable accurate ($\lesssim$0.1 dex)
and simultaneous measurements of 14 stellar parameters -- including 11
elemental abundances -- from real spectroscopic observations. As massively
multiplexed astronomical surveys begin scientific operations, cecilia's
performance has the potential to unlock large-scale studies of extrasolar
geochemistry and propel the field of white dwarf science into the era of Big
Data. In doing so, we aspire to uncover new statistical insights that were
previously impractical with traditional white dwarf characterisation
techniques.",2024-02-07T19:00:02Z
"Estimating Coronal Mass Ejection Mass and Kinetic Energy by Fusion of
  Multiple Deep-learning Models","Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are massive solar eruptions, which have a
significant impact on Earth. In this paper, we propose a new method, called
DeepCME, to estimate two properties of CMEs, namely, CME mass and kinetic
energy. Being able to estimate these properties helps better understand CME
dynamics. Our study is based on the CME catalog maintained at the Coordinated
Data Analysis Workshops (CDAW) Data Center, which contains all CMEs manually
identified since 1996 using the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph
(LASCO) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). We use LASCO C2
data in the period between January 1996 and December 2020 to train, validate
and test DeepCME through 10-fold cross validation. The DeepCME method is a
fusion of three deep learning models, including ResNet, InceptionNet, and
InceptionResNet. Our fusion model extracts features from LASCO C2 images,
effectively combining the learning capabilities of the three component models
to jointly estimate the mass and kinetic energy of CMEs. Experimental results
show that the fusion model yields a mean relative error (MRE) of 0.013 (0.009,
respectively) compared to the MRE of 0.019 (0.017, respectively) of the best
component model InceptionResNet (InceptionNet, respectively) in estimating the
CME mass (kinetic energy, respectively). To our knowledge, this is the first
time that deep learning has been used for CME mass and kinetic energy
estimations.",2023-12-04T07:25:55Z
"Using U-Nets to Create High-Fidelity Virtual Observations of the Solar
  Corona","Understanding and monitoring the complex and dynamic processes of the Sun is
important for a number of human activities on Earth and in space. For this
reason, NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) has been continuously
monitoring the multi-layered Sun's atmosphere in high-resolution since its
launch in 2010, generating terabytes of observational data every day. The
synergy between machine learning and this enormous amount of data has the
potential, still largely unexploited, to advance our understanding of the Sun
and extend the capabilities of heliophysics missions. In the present work, we
show that deep learning applied to SDO data can be successfully used to create
a high-fidelity virtual telescope that generates synthetic observations of the
solar corona by image translation. Towards this end we developed a deep neural
network, structured as an encoder-decoder with skip connections (U-Net), that
reconstructs the Sun's image of one instrument channel given temporally aligned
images in three other channels. The approach we present has the potential to
reduce the telemetry needs of SDO, enhance the capabilities of missions that
have less observing channels, and transform the concept development of future
missions.",2019-11-10T22:48:56Z
"Implementation paradigm for supervised flare forecasting studies: a deep
  learning application with video data","Solar flare forecasting can be realized by means of the analysis of magnetic
data through artificial intelligence techniques. The aim is to predict whether
a magnetic active region (AR) will originate solar flares above a certain class
within a certain amount of time. A crucial issue is concerned with the way the
adopted machine learning method is implemented, since forecasting results
strongly depend on the criterion with which training, validation, and test sets
are populated. In this paper we propose a general paradigm to generate these
sets in such a way that they are independent from each other and internally
well-balanced in terms of AR flaring effectiveness. This set generation process
provides a ground for comparison for the performance assessment of machine
learning algorithms. Finally, we use this implementation paradigm in the case
of a deep neural network, which takes as input videos of magnetograms recorded
by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO/HMI). To our knowledge, this is the first time that the solar flare
forecasting problem is addressed by means of a deep neural network for video
classification, which does not require any a priori extraction of features from
the HMI magnetograms.",2021-10-24T23:26:41Z
"Light Curve Classification with DistClassiPy: a new distance-based
  classifier","The rise of synoptic sky surveys has ushered in an era of big data in
time-domain astronomy, making data science and machine learning essential tools
for studying celestial objects. While tree-based models (e.g. Random Forests)
and deep learning models dominate the field, we explore the use of different
distance metrics to aid in the classification of astrophysical objects. We
developed DistClassiPy, a new distance metric based classifier. The direct use
of distance metrics is unexplored in time-domain astronomy, but distance-based
methods can help make classification more interpretable and decrease
computational costs. In particular, we applied DistClassiPy to classify light
curves of variable stars, comparing the distances between objects of different
classes. Using 18 distance metrics on a catalog of 6,000 variable stars across
10 classes, we demonstrate classification and dimensionality reduction. Our
classifier meets state-of-the-art performance but has lower computational
requirements and improved interpretability. Additionally, DistClassiPy can be
tailored to specific objects by identifying the most effective distance metric
for that classification. To facilitate broader applications within and beyond
astronomy, we have made DistClassiPy open-source and available at
https://pypi.org/project/distclassipy/.",2024-03-18T18:00:00Z
"Deep Learning and LLM-based Methods Applied to Stellar Lightcurve
  Classification","Light curves serve as a valuable source of information on stellar formation
and evolution. With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques, it
can be effectively processed to extract astronomical patterns and information.
In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of deep-learning and large
language model (LLM) based models for the automatic classification of variable
star light curves, based on large datasets from the Kepler and K2 missions.
Special emphasis is placed on Cepheids, RR Lyrae, and eclipsing binaries,
examining the influence of observational cadence and phase distribution on
classification precision. Employing AutoDL optimization, we achieve striking
performance with the 1D-Convolution+BiLSTM architecture and the Swin
Transformer, hitting accuracies of 94\% and 99\% correspondingly, with the
latter demonstrating a notable 83\% accuracy in discerning the elusive Type II
Cepheids-comprising merely 0.02\% of the total dataset.We unveil StarWhisper
LightCurve (LC), an innovative Series comprising three LLM-based models: LLM,
multimodal large language model (MLLM), and Large Audio Language Model (LALM).
Each model is fine-tuned with strategic prompt engineering and customized
training methods to explore the emergent abilities of these models for
astronomical data. Remarkably, StarWhisper LC Series exhibit high accuracies
around 90\%, significantly reducing the need for explicit feature engineering,
thereby paving the way for streamlined parallel data processing and the
progression of multifaceted multimodal models in astronomical applications. The
study furnishes two detailed catalogs illustrating the impacts of phase and
sampling intervals on deep learning classification accuracy, showing that a
substantial decrease of up to 14\% in observation duration and 21\% in sampling
points can be realized without compromising accuracy by more than 10\%.",2024-04-16T17:35:25Z
"Deep Learning application for stellar parameters determination: I-
  Constraining the hyperparameters","Machine Learning is an efficient method for analyzing and interpreting the
increasing amount of astronomical data that is available. In this study, we
show, a pedagogical approach that should benefit anyone willing to experiment
with Deep Learning techniques in the context of stellar parameters
determination. Utilizing the Convolutional Neural Network architecture, we give
a step by step overview of how to select the optimal parameters for deriving
the most accurate values for the stellar parameters of stars: T$_{\rm{eff}}$,
$\log g$, [X/H], and $v_e \sin i$. Synthetic spectra with random noise were
used to constrain this method and to mimic the observations. We found that each
stellar parameter requires a different combination of network hyperparameters
and the maximum accuracy reached depends on this combination, as well as, the
Signal to Noise ratio of the observations, and the architecture of the network.
We also show that this technique can be applied to other spectral types in
different wavelength ranges after the technique has been optimized.",2022-01-29T02:07:02Z
"Deep-learning based measurement of planetary radial velocities in the
  presence of stellar variability","We present a deep-learning based approach for measuring small planetary
radial velocities in the presence of stellar variability. We use neural
networks to reduce stellar RV jitter in three years of HARPS-N sun-as-a-star
spectra. We develop and compare dimensionality-reduction and data splitting
methods, as well as various neural network architectures including single line
CNNs, an ensemble of single line CNNs, and a multi-line CNN. We inject
planet-like RVs into the spectra and use the network to recover them. We find
that the multi-line CNN is able to recover planets with 0.2 m/s semi-amplitude,
50 day period, with 8.8% error in the amplitude and 0.7% in the period. This
approach shows promise for mitigating stellar RV variability and enabling the
detection of small planetary RVs with unprecedented precision.",2023-04-10T18:33:36Z
"Construction of a Calibrated Probabilistic Classification Catalog:
  Application to 50k Variable Sources in the All-Sky Automated Survey","With growing data volumes from synoptic surveys, astronomers must become more
abstracted from the discovery and introspection processes. Given the scarcity
of follow-up resources, there is a particularly sharp onus on the frameworks
that replace these human roles to provide accurate and well-calibrated
probabilistic classification catalogs. Such catalogs inform the subsequent
follow-up, allowing consumers to optimize the selection of specific sources for
further study and permitting rigorous treatment of purities and efficiencies
for population studies. Here, we describe a process to produce a probabilistic
classification catalog of variability with machine learning from a multi-epoch
photometric survey. In addition to producing accurate classifications, we show
how to estimate calibrated class probabilities, and motivate the importance of
probability calibration. We also introduce a methodology for feature-based
anomaly detection, which allows discovery of objects in the survey that do not
fit within the predefined class taxonomy. Finally, we apply these methods to
sources observed by the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS), and unveil the
Machine-learned ASAS Classification Catalog (MACC), which is a 28-class
probabilistic classification catalog of 50,124 ASAS sources. We estimate that
MACC achieves a sub-20% classification error rate, and demonstrate that the
class posterior probabilities are reasonably calibrated. MACC classifications
compare favorably to the classifications of several previous domain-specific
ASAS papers and to the ASAS Catalog of Variable Stars, which had classified
only 24% of those sources into one of 12 science classes. The MACC is publicly
available at http://www.bigmacc.info.",2012-04-18T20:00:00Z
"K2 Variable Catalogue II: Machine Learning Classification of Variable
  Stars and Eclipsing Binaries in K2 Fields 0-4","We are entering an era of unprecedented quantities of data from current and
planned survey telescopes. To maximise the potential of such surveys, automated
data analysis techniques are required. Here we implement a new methodology for
variable star classification, through the combination of Kohonen Self
Organising Maps (SOM, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm) and the more
common Random Forest (RF) supervised machine learning technique. We apply this
method to data from the K2 mission fields 0-4, finding 154 ab-type RR Lyraes
(10 newly discovered), 377 Delta Scuti pulsators, 133 Gamma Doradus pulsators,
183 detached eclipsing binaries, 290 semi-detached or contact eclipsing
binaries and 9399 other periodic (mostly spot-modulated) sources, once class
significance cuts are taken into account. We present lightcurve features for
all K2 stellar targets, including their three strongest detected frequencies,
which can be used to study stellar rotation periods where the observed
variability arises from spot modulation. The resulting catalogue of variable
stars, classes, and associated data features are made available online. We
publish our SOM code in Python as part of the open source PyMVPA package, which
in combination with already available RF modules can be easily used to recreate
the method.",2015-12-03T21:08:26Z
"Machine learning in APOGEE: Identification of stellar populations
  through chemical abundances","The vast volume of data generated by modern astronomical surveys offers test
beds for the application of machine-learning. It is important to evaluate
potential existing tools and determine those that are optimal for extracting
scientific knowledge from the available observations. We explore the
possibility of using clustering algorithms to separate stellar populations with
distinct chemical patterns. Star clusters are likely the most chemically
homogeneous populations in the Galaxy, and therefore any practical approach to
identifying distinct stellar populations should at least be able to separate
clusters from each other. We applied eight clustering algorithms combined with
four dimensionality reduction strategies to automatically distinguish stellar
clusters using chemical abundances of 13 elements. Our sample includes 18
stellar clusters with a total of 453 stars. We use statistical tests showing
that some pairs of clusters are indistinguishable from each other when chemical
abundances from the Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) are
used. However, for most clusters we are able to automatically assign membership
with metric scores similar to previous works. The confusion level of the
automatically selected clusters is consistent with statistical tests that
demonstrate the impossibility of perfectly distinguishing all the clusters from
each other. These statistical tests and confusion levels establish a limit for
the prospect of blindly identifying stars born in the same cluster based solely
on chemical abundances. We find that some of the algorithms we explored are
capable of blindly identify stellar populations with similar ages and chemical
distributions in the APOGEE data. Because some stellar clusters are chemically
indistinguishable, our study supports the notion of extending weak chemical
tagging that involves families of clusters instead of individual clusters",2019-07-30T09:21:53Z
"Machine learning in APOGEE: Unsupervised spectral classification with
  $K$-means","The data volume generated by astronomical surveys is growing rapidly.
Traditional analysis techniques in spectroscopy either demand intensive human
interaction or are computationally expensive. In this scenario, machine
learning, and unsupervised clustering algorithms in particular offer
interesting alternatives. The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution
Experiment (APOGEE) offers a vast data set of near-infrared stellar spectra
which is perfect for testing such alternatives. Apply an unsupervised
classification scheme based on $K$-means to the massive APOGEE data set.
Explore whether the data are amenable to classification into discrete classes.
We apply the $K$-means algorithm to 153,847 high resolution spectra
($R\approx22,500$). We discuss the main virtues and weaknesses of the
algorithm, as well as our choice of parameters. We show that a classification
based on normalised spectra captures the variations in stellar atmospheric
parameters, chemical abundances, and rotational velocity, among other factors.
The algorithm is able to separate the bulge and halo populations, and
distinguish dwarfs, sub-giants, RC and RGB stars. However, a discrete
classification in flux space does not result in a neat organisation in the
parameters space. Furthermore, the lack of obvious groups in flux space causes
the results to be fairly sensitive to the initialisation, and disrupts the
efficiency of commonly-used methods to select the optimal number of clusters.
Our classification is publicly available, including extensive online material
associated with the APOGEE Data Release 12 (DR12). Our description of the
APOGEE database can enormously help with the identification of specific types
of targets for various applications. We find a lack of obvious groups in flux
space, and identify limitations of the $K$-means algorithm in dealing with this
kind of data.",2018-01-24T10:24:23Z

Machine learning initialization to accelerate Stokes profile inversions,"In this work, we discuss the application of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) as a tool to advantageously initialize Stokes profile inversions. To
demonstrate the usefulness of CNNs, we concentrate in this paper on the
inversion of LTE Stokes profiles. We use observations taken with the
spectropolarimeter onboard the Hinode spacecraft as a test benchmark. First, we
carefully analyze the data with the SIR inversion code using a given initial
atmospheric model. The code provides a set of atmospheric models that reproduce
the observations. These models are then used to train a CNN. Afterwards, the
same data are again inverted with SIR but using the trained CNN to provide the
initial guess atmospheric models for SIR. The CNNs allow us to significantly
reduce the number of inversion cycles when used to compute initial guess model
atmospheres, decreasing the computational time for LTE inversions by a factor
of two to four. CNN's alone are much faster than assisted inversions, but the
latter are more robust and accurate. The advantages and limitations of machine
learning techniques for estimating optimum initial atmospheric models for
spectral line inversions are discussed. Finally, we describe a python wrapper
for the SIR and DeSIRe codes that allows for the easy setup of parallel
inversions. The assisted inversions can speed up the inversion process, but the
efficiency and accuracy of the inversion results depend strongly on the solar
scene and the data used for the CNN training. This method (assisted inversions)
will not obviate the need for analyzing individual events with the utmost care
but will provide solar scientists with a much better opportunity to sample
large amounts of inverted data, which will undoubtedly broaden the physical
discovery space.",2021-03-16T00:53:34Z

predict the proton intensities at energies from 28 to 1,885 keV in the 3D
terrestrial magnetosphere at radial distances between 6 and 22 RE. We used the
satellite location and indices for solar, solar wind and geomagnetic activity
as predictors. The results demonstrate that the neural network (multi-layer
perceptron regressor) outperforms baseline models based on the k-Nearest
Neighbors and historical binning on average by ~80% and ~33\%, respectively.
The average correlation between the observed and predicted data is about 56%,
which is reasonable in light of the complex dynamics of fast-moving energetic
protons in the magnetosphere. In addition to a quantitative analysis of the
prediction results, we also investigate parameter importance in our model. The
most decisive parameters for predicting proton intensities are related to the
location: ZGSE direction and the radial distance. Among the activity indices,
the solar wind dynamic pressure is the most important. The results have a
direct practical application, for instance, for assessing the contamination
particle background in the X-Ray telescopes for X-ray astronomy orbiting above
the radiation belts. To foster reproducible research and to enable the
community to build upon our work we publish our complete code, the data, as
well as weights of trained models. Further description can be found in the

"Early recognition of Microlensing Events from Archival Photometry with
  Machine Learning Methods","Gravitational microlensing method is a powerful method to detect isolated
black holes in the Milky Way. During a microlensing event brightness of the
source increases and this feature is used by many photometric surveys to alert
on potential events. A typical microlensing event shows a characteristic light
curve, however, some outbursting variable stars may show similar light curves
to microlensing events especially when the cadence of observations is not dense
enough. Our aim is to device a method for distinguishing candidates for
microlensing events from any other types of alerts using solely their archival
photometric multi-wavelength data. The most common contaminants in the
microlensing event search are Classical Be-type stars, Young Stellar Objects
and Asymptotic Giant Branch stars such as Miras. We build a training set using
thousands of examples for the main classes of alerting stars combining optical
to mid-infrared magnitudes from Gaia, 2MASS and AllWISE catalogues. We used
supervised machine learning techniques to build models for classification of
alerts. We verified our method on 120 microlensing events reported by Gaia
Science Alerts which were studied spectroscopically and photometrically. With
the use of only archival information at 90% probability threshold we correctly
identified one-third of the microlensing events. We also run our classifier on
positions of 368 Gaia alerts which were flagged as potential candidates for
microlensing events. At the 90% probability threshold we classified 38
microlensing events and 29 other types of variables. The machine learning
supported method we developed can be universally used for current and future
alerting surveys in order to quickly assess the classification of galactic
transients and help decide on further follow-up observations.",2022-01-28T16:07:39Z
"Supervised machine learning on Galactic filaments Revealing the
  filamentary structure of the Galactic interstellar medium","Context. Filaments are ubiquitous in the Galaxy, and they host star
formation. Detecting them in a reliable way is therefore key towards our
understanding of the star formation process.
  Aims. We explore whether supervised machine learning can identify filamentary
structures on the whole Galactic plane.
  Methods. We used two versions of UNet-based networks for image
segmentation.We used H2 column density images of the Galactic plane obtained
with Herschel Hi-GAL data as input data. We trained the UNet-based networks
with skeletons (spine plus branches) of filaments that were extracted from
these images, together with background and missing data masks that we produced.
We tested eight training scenarios to determine the best scenario for our
astrophysical purpose of classifying pixels as filaments.
  Results. The training of the UNets allows us to create a new image of the
Galactic plane by segmentation in which pixels belonging to filamentary
structures are identified. With this new method, we classify more pixels (more
by a factor of 2 to 7, depending on the classification threshold used) as
belonging to filaments than the spine plus branches structures we used as
input. New structures are revealed, which are mainly low-contrast filaments
that were not detected before.We use standard metrics to evaluate the
performances of the different training scenarios. This allows us to demonstrate
the robustness of the method and to determine an optimal threshold value that
maximizes the recovery of the input labelled pixel classification.
  Conclusions. This proof-of-concept study shows that supervised machine
learning can reveal filamentary structures that are present throughout the
Galactic plane. The detection of these structures, including low-density and
low-contrast structures that have never been seen before, offers important
perspectives for the study of these filaments.",2022-12-01T12:34:12Z
"A Machine Learning approach for correcting radial velocities using
  physical observables","Precision radial velocity (RV) measurements continue to be a key tool to
detect and characterise extrasolar planets. While instrumental precision keeps
improving, stellar activity remains a barrier to obtain reliable measurements
below 1-2 m/s accuracy. Using simulations and real data, we investigate the
capabilities of a Deep Neural Network approach to produce activity free Doppler
measurements of stars. As case studies we use observations of two known stars
(Eps Eridani and AUMicroscopii), both with clear signals of activity induced RV
variability. Synthetic data using the starsim code are generated for the
observables (inputs) and the resulting RV signal (labels), and used to train a
Deep Neural Network algorithm. We identify an architecture consisting of
convolutional and fully connected layers that is adequate to the task. The
indices investigated are mean line-profile parameters (width, bisector,
contrast) and multi-band photometry. We demonstrate that the RV-independent
approach can drastically reduce spurious Doppler variability from known
physical effects such as spots, rotation and convective blueshift. We identify
the combinations of activity indices with most predictive power. When applied
to real observations, we observe a good match of the correction with the
observed variability, but we also find that the noise reduction is not as good
as in the simulations, probably due to the lack of detail in the simulated
physics. We demonstrate that a model-driven machine learning approach is
sufficient to clean Doppler signals from activity induced variability for well
known physical effects. There are dozens of known activity related observables
whose inversion power remains unexplored indicating that the use of additional
indicators, more complete models, and more observations with optimised sampling
strategies can lead to significant improvements in our detrending capabilities.",2023-01-30T13:25:00Z
"Intercomparison of Brown Dwarf Model Grids and Atmospheric Retrieval
  Using Machine Learning","Understanding differences between sub-stellar spectral data and models has
proven to be a major challenge, especially for self-consistent model grids that
are necessary for a thorough investigation of brown dwarf atmospheres. Using
the supervised machine learning method of the random forest, we study the
information content of 14 previously published model grids of brown dwarfs
(from 1997 to 2021). The random forest method allows us to analyze the
predictive power of these model grids, as well as interpret data within the
framework of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). Our curated dataset
includes 3 benchmark brown dwarfs (Gl 570D, {\epsilon} Indi Ba and Bb) as well
as a sample of 19 L and T dwarfs; this sample was previously analyzed in Lueber
et al. (2022) using traditional Bayesian methods (nested sampling). We find
that the effective temperature of a brown dwarf can be robustly predicted
independent of the model grid chosen for the interpretation. However, inference
of the surface gravity is model-dependent. Specifically, the BT-Settl, Sonora
Bobcat and Sonora Cholla model grids tend to predict logg ~3-4 (cgs units) even
after data blueward of 1.2 {\mu}m have been disregarded to mitigate for our
incomplete knowledge of the shapes of alkali lines. Two major, longstanding
challenges associated with understanding the influence of clouds in brown dwarf
atmospheres remain: our inability to model them from first principles and also
to robustly validate these models.",2023-05-12T18:20:38Z
"A Machine Learning Approach to Understanding the Physical Properties of
  Magnetic Flux Ropes in the Solar Wind at 1 AU","Interplanetary magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) are commonly observed structures in
the solar wind, categorized as magnetic clouds (MCs) and small-scale MFRs
(SMFRs) depending on whether they are associated with coronal mass ejections.
We apply machine learning to systematically compare SMFRs, MCs, and ambient
solar wind plasma properties. We construct a dataset of 3-minute averaged
sequential data points of the solar wind's instantaneous bulk fluid plasma
properties using about twenty years of measurements from \emph{Wind}. We label
samples by the presence and type of MFRs containing them using a catalog based
on Grad-Shafranov (GS) automated detection for SMFRs and NASA's catalog for MCs
(with samples in neither labeled non-MFRs). We apply the random forest machine
learning algorithm to find which categories can be more easily distinguished
and by what features. MCs were distinguished from non-MFRs with an AUC of 94%
and SMFRs with an AUC of 89% and had distinctive plasma properties. In
contrast, while SMFRs were distinguished from non-MFRs with an AUC of 86%, this
appears to rely solely on the $\langle B \rangle$ > 5 nT threshold applied by
the GS catalog. The results indicate that SMFRs have virtually the same plasma
properties as the ambient solar wind, unlike the distinct plasma regimes of
MCs. We interpret our findings as additional evidence that most SMFRs at 1 au
are generated within the solar wind, and furthermore, suggesting that they
should be considered a salient feature of the solar wind's magnetic structure
rather than transient events.",2023-11-15T20:07:21Z
"Machine learning-based identification of Gaia astrometric exoplanet
  orbits","The third Gaia data release (DR3) contains $\sim$170 000 astrometric orbit
solutions of two-body systems located within $\sim$500 pc of the Sun.
Determining component masses in these systems, in particular of stars hosting
exoplanets, usually hinges on incorporating complementary observations in
addition to the astrometry, e.g. spectroscopy and radial velocities. Several
DR3 two-body systems with exoplanet, brown-dwarf, stellar, and black-hole
components have been confirmed in this way. We developed an alternative machine
learning approach that uses only the DR3 orbital solutions with the aim of
identifying the best candidates for exoplanets and brown-dwarf companions.
Based on confirmed substellar companions in the literature, we use
semi-supervised anomaly detection methods in combination with extreme gradient
boosting and random forest classifiers to determine likely low-mass outliers in
the population of non-single sources. We employ and study feature importance to
investigate the method's plausibility and produced a list of 22 best candidates
of which four are exoplanet candidates and another five are either very-massive
brown dwarfs or very-low mass stars. Three candidates, including one initial
exoplanet candidate, correspond to false-positive solutions where longer-period
binary star motion was fitted with a biased shorter-period orbit. We highlight
nine candidates with brown-dwarf companions for preferential follow-up. One
candidate companion around the Sun-like star G 15-6 could be confirmed as a
genuine brown dwarf using external radial-velocity data. This new approach is a
powerful complement to the traditional identification methods for substellar
companions among Gaia astrometric orbits. It is particularly relevant in the
context of Gaia DR4 and its expected exoplanet discovery yield.",2024-04-14T20:17:14Z
Using Multiple Instance Learning for Explainable Solar Flare Prediction,"In this work we leverage a weakly-labeled dataset of spectral data from NASAs
IRIS satellite for the prediction of solar flares using the Multiple Instance
Learning (MIL) paradigm. While standard supervised learning models expect a
label for every instance, MIL relaxes this and only considers bags of instances
to be labeled. This is ideally suited for flare prediction with IRIS data that
consists of time series of bags of UV spectra measured along the instrument
slit. In particular, we consider the readout window around the Mg II h&k lines
that encodes information on the dynamics of the solar chromosphere. Our MIL
models are not only able to predict whether flares occur within the next
$\sim$25 minutes with accuracies of around 90%, but are also able to explain
which spectral profiles were particularly important for their bag-level
prediction. This information can be used to highlight regions of interest in
ongoing IRIS observations in real-time and to identify candidates for typical
flare precursor spectral profiles. We use k-means clustering to extract groups
of spectral profiles that appear relevant for flare prediction. The recovered
groups show high intensity, triplet red wing emission and single-peaked h and k
lines, as found by previous works. They seem to be related to small-scale
explosive events that have been reported to occur tens of minutes before a
flare.",2022-03-25T20:15:35Z
"Exploring the spectroscopic diversity of type Ia supernovae with
  DRACULA: a machine learning approach","The existence of multiple subclasses of type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) has been
the subject of great debate in the last decade. One major challenge inevitably
met when trying to infer the existence of one or more subclasses is the time
consuming, and subjective, process of subclass definition. In this work, we
show how machine learning tools facilitate identification of subtypes of SNeIa
through the establishment of a hierarchical group structure in the continuous
space of spectral diversity formed by these objects. Using Deep Learning, we
were capable of performing such identification in a 4 dimensional feature space
(+1 for time evolution), while the standard Principal Component Analysis barely
achieves similar results using 15 principal components. This is evidence that
the progenitor system and the explosion mechanism can be described by a small
number of initial physical parameters. As a proof of concept, we show that our
results are in close agreement with a previously suggested classification
scheme and that our proposed method can grasp the main spectral features behind
the definition of such subtypes. This allows the confirmation of the velocity
of lines as a first order effect in the determination of SNIa subtypes,
followed by 91bg-like events. Given the expected data deluge in the forthcoming
years, our proposed approach is essential to allow a quick and statistically
coherent identification of SNeIa subtypes (and outliers). All tools used in
this work were made publicly available in the Python package Dimensionality
Reduction And Clustering for Unsupervised Learning in Astronomy (DRACULA) and
can be found within COINtoolbox (https://github.com/COINtoolbox/DRACULA).",2015-12-21T20:32:47Z
"Inferring Line-of-Sight Velocities and Doppler Widths from Stokes
  Profiles of GST/NIRIS Using Stacked Deep Neural Networks","Obtaining high-quality magnetic and velocity fields through Stokes inversion
is crucial in solar physics. In this paper, we present a new deep learning
method, named Stacked Deep Neural Networks (SDNN), for inferring line-of-sight
(LOS) velocities and Doppler widths from Stokes profiles collected by the Near
InfraRed Imaging Spectropolarimeter (NIRIS) on the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope
(GST) at the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). The training data of SDNN is
prepared by a Milne-Eddington (ME) inversion code used by BBSO. We
quantitatively assess SDNN, comparing its inversion results with those obtained
by the ME inversion code and related machine learning (ML) algorithms such as
multiple support vector regression, multilayer perceptrons and a pixel-level
convolutional neural network. Major findings from our experimental study are
summarized as follows. First, the SDNN-inferred LOS velocities are highly
correlated to the ME-calculated ones with the Pearson product-moment
correlation coefficient being close to 0.9 on average. Second, SDNN is faster,
while producing smoother and cleaner LOS velocity and Doppler width maps, than
the ME inversion code. Third, the maps produced by SDNN are closer to ME's maps
than those from the related ML algorithms, demonstrating the better learning
capability of SDNN than the ML algorithms. Finally, comparison between the
inversion results of ME and SDNN based on GST/NIRIS and those from the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory in
flare-prolific active region NOAA 12673 is presented. We also discuss
extensions of SDNN for inferring vector magnetic fields with empirical
evaluation.",2022-10-08T23:19:05Z

"Fundamental Parameters of Main-Sequence Stars in an Instant with Machine
  Learning","Owing to the remarkable photometric precision of space observatories like
Kepler, stellar and planetary systems beyond our own are now being
characterized en masse for the first time. These characterizations are pivotal
for endeavors such as searching for Earth-like planets and solar twins,
understanding the mechanisms that govern stellar evolution, and tracing the
dynamics of our Galaxy. The volume of data that is becoming available, however,
brings with it the need to process this information accurately and rapidly.
While existing methods can constrain fundamental stellar parameters such as
ages, masses, and radii from these observations, they require substantial
computational efforts to do so.
  We develop a method based on machine learning for rapidly estimating
fundamental parameters of main-sequence solar-like stars from classical and
asteroseismic observations. We first demonstrate this method on a
hare-and-hound exercise and then apply it to the Sun, 16 Cyg A & B, and 34
planet-hosting candidates that have been observed by the Kepler spacecraft. We
find that our estimates and their associated uncertainties are comparable to
the results of other methods, but with the additional benefit of being able to
explore many more stellar parameters while using much less computation time. We
furthermore use this method to present evidence for an empirical diffusion-mass
relation. Our method is open source and freely available for the community to
use.

"Calibrating Long Period Variables as Standard Candles with Machine
  Learning","Variable stars with well-calibrated period-luminosity relationships provide
accurate distance measurements to nearby galaxies and are therefore a vital
tool for cosmology and astrophysics. While these measurements typically rely on
samples of Cepheid and RR-Lyrae stars, abundant populations of luminous
variable stars with longer periods of $10 - 1000$ days remain largely unused.
We apply machine learning to derive a mapping between lightcurve features of
these variable stars and their magnitude to extend the traditional
period-luminosity (PL) relation commonly used for Cepheid samples. Using
photometric data for long period variable stars in the Large Magellanic cloud
(LMC), we demonstrate that our predictions produce residual errors comparable
to those obtained on the corresponding Cepheid population. We show that our
model generalizes well to other samples by performing a blind test on
photometric data from the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our predictions on the
SMC again show small residual errors and biases, comparable to results that
employ PL relations fitted on Cepheid samples. The residual biases are
complementary between the long period variable and Cepheid fits, which provides
exciting prospects to better control sources of systematic error in
cosmological distance measurements. We finally show that the proposed
methodology can be used to optimize samples of variable stars as standard
candles independent of any prior variable star classification.",2018-06-07T18:00:13Z
Classifying High-cadence Microlensing Light Curves I; Defining Features,"Microlensing is a powerful tool for discovering cold exoplanets, and the The
Roman Space Telescope microlensing survey will discover over 1000 such planets.
Rapid, automated classification of Roman's microlensing events can be used to
prioritize follow-up observations of the most interesting events. Machine
learning is now often used for classification problems in astronomy, but the
success of such algorithms can rely on the definition of appropriate features
that capture essential elements of the observations that can map to parameters
of interest. In this paper, we introduce tools that we have developed to
capture features in simulated Roman light curves of different types of
microlensing events, and evaluate their effectiveness in classifying
microlensing light curves. These features are quantified as parameters that can
be used to decide the likelihood that a given light curve is due to a specific
type of microlensing event. This method leaves us with a list of parameters
that describe features like the smoothness of the peak, symmetry, the number of
peaks, and width and height of small deviations from the main peak. This will
allow us to quickly analyze a set of microlensing light curves and later use
the resulting parameters as input to machine learning algorithms to classify
the events.",2021-01-11T16:46:24Z
Sketch and Scale: Geo-distributed tSNE and UMAP,"Running machine learning analytics over geographically distributed datasets
is a rapidly arising problem in the world of data management policies ensuring
privacy and data security. Visualizing high dimensional data using tools such
as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) and Uniform Manifold
Approximation and Projection (UMAP) became common practice for data scientists.
Both tools scale poorly in time and memory. While recent optimizations showed
successful handling of 10,000 data points, scaling beyond million points is
still challenging. We introduce a novel framework: Sketch and Scale (SnS). It
leverages a Count Sketch data structure to compress the data on the edge nodes,
aggregates the reduced size sketches on the master node, and runs vanilla tSNE
or UMAP on the summary, representing the densest areas, extracted from the
aggregated sketch. We show this technique to be fully parallel, scale linearly
in time, logarithmically in memory, and communication, making it possible to
analyze datasets with many millions, potentially billions of data points,
spread across several data centers around the globe. We demonstrate the power
of our method on two mid-size datasets: cancer data with 52 million 35-band
pixels from multiple images of tumor biopsies; and astrophysics data of 100
million stars with multi-color photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS).",2020-11-11T22:32:21Z
A Machine Learning Technique to Identify Transit Shaped Signals,"We describe a new metric that uses machine learning to determine if a
periodic signal found in a photometric time series appears to be shaped like
the signature of a transiting exoplanet. This metric uses dimensionality
reduction and k-nearest neighbors to determine whether a given signal is
sufficiently similar to known transits in the same data set. This metric is
being used by the Kepler Robovetter to determine which signals should be part
of the Q1-Q17 DR24 catalog of planetary candidates. The Kepler Mission reports
roughly 20,000 potential transiting signals with each run of its pipeline, yet
only a few thousand appear sufficiently transit shaped to be part of the
catalog. The other signals tend to be variable stars and instrumental noise.
With this metric we are able to remove more than 90% of the non-transiting
signals while retaining more than 99% of the known planet candidates. When
tested with injected transits, less than 1% are lost. This metric will enable
the Kepler mission and future missions looking for transiting planets to
rapidly and consistently find the best planetary candidates for follow-up and
cataloging.",2015-08-31T20:23:47Z
A Machine Learning Classifier for Microlensing in Wide-Field Surveys,"While microlensing is very rare, occurring on average once per million stars
observed, current and near-future surveys are coming online with the capability
of providing photometry of almost the entire visible sky to depths up to R ~ 22
mag or fainter every few days, which will contribute to the detection of black
holes and exoplanets through follow-up observations of microlensing events.
Based on galactic models, we can expect microlensing events across a vastly
wider region of the galaxy, although the cadence of these surveys (2-3 per day
) is lower than traditional microlensing surveys, making efficient detection a
challenge. Rapid advances are being made in the utility of time-series data to
detect and classify transient events in real-time using very high data-rate
surveys, but limited work has been published regarding the detection of
microlensing events, particularly for when the data streams are of relatively
low-cadence. In this research, we explore the utility of a Random Forest
algorithm for identifying microlensing signals using time-series data, with the
goal of creating an efficient machine learning classifier that can be applied
to search for microlensing in wide-field surveys even with low-cadence data. We
have applied and optimized our classifier using the OGLE-II microlensing
dataset, in addition to testing with PTF/iPTF survey data and the currently
operating ZTF, which applies the same data handling infrastructure that is
envisioned for the upcoming LSST.",2020-04-29T17:25:23Z
StarcNet: Machine Learning for Star Cluster Identification,"We present a machine learning (ML) pipeline to identify star clusters in the
multi{color images of nearby galaxies, from observations obtained with the
Hubble Space Telescope as part of the Treasury Project LEGUS (Legacy
ExtraGalactic Ultraviolet Survey). StarcNet (STAR Cluster classification
NETwork) is a multi-scale convolutional neural network (CNN) which achieves an
accuracy of 68.6% (4 classes)/86.0% (2 classes: cluster/non-cluster) for star
cluster classification in the images of the LEGUS galaxies, nearly matching
human expert performance. We test the performance of StarcNet by applying
pre-trained CNN model to galaxies not included in the training set, finding
accuracies similar to the reference one. We test the effect of StarcNet
predictions on the inferred cluster properties by comparing multi-color
luminosity functions and mass-age plots from catalogs produced by StarcNet and
by human-labeling; distributions in luminosity, color, and physical
characteristics of star clusters are similar for the human and ML classified
samples. There are two advantages to the ML approach: (1) reproducibility of
the classifications: the ML algorithm's biases are fixed and can be measured
for subsequent analysis; and (2) speed of classification: the algorithm
requires minutes for tasks that humans require weeks to months to perform. By
achieving comparable accuracy to human classifiers, StarcNet will enable
extending classifications to a larger number of candidate samples than
currently available, thus increasing significantly the statistics for cluster
studies.",2020-12-16T23:58:01Z
"Structural properties and classification of variable stars: A study
  through unsupervised machine learning techniques","The advancement in the field of data science especially in machine learning
along with vast databases of variable star projects like the Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) encourages researchers to analyse as
well as classify light curves of different variable stars automatically with
efficiency. In the present work, we have demonstrated the relative performances
of principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA)
applying to huge databases of OGLE variable star light curves after obtaining
1000 magnitudes between phase 0 to 1 with step length 0.001 for each light
curves in identifying resonances for fundamental mode (FU) and first overtone
(FO) Cepheids and in the classification of variable stars for Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC), Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) as well as Milky Way (MW). We have
seen that the performance of ICA is better for finding resonances for Cepheid
variables as well as for accurately classifying large data sets of light curves
than PCA. Using K-means clustering algorithm (CA) with respect to independent
components (ICs), we have plotted period-luminosity diagrams and
colour-magnitude diagrams separately for LMC, SMC and MW and found that ICA
along with K-means CA is a very robust tool for classification as well as
future prediction on the nature of light curves of variable stars.",2022-01-21T16:05:38Z
"YOUNG Star detrending for Transiting Exoplanet Recovery (YOUNGSTER) II:
  Using Self-Organising Maps to explore young star variability in Sectors 1-13
  of TESS data","Young exoplanets and their corresponding host stars are fascinating
laboratories for constraining the timescale of planetary evolution and
planet-star interactions. However, because young stars are typically much more
active than the older population, in order to discover more young exoplanets,
greater knowledge of the wide array of young star variability is needed. Here
Kohonen Self Organising Maps (SOMs) are used to explore young star variability
present in the first year of observations from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (TESS), with such knowledge valuable to perform targeted detrending
of young stars in the future. This technique was found to be particularly
effective at separating the signals of young eclipsing binaries and potential
transiting objects from stellar variability, a list of which are provided in
this paper. The effect of pre-training the Self-Organising Maps on known
variability classes was tested, but found to be challenging without a
significant training set from TESS. SOMs were also found to provide an
intuitive and informative overview of leftover systematics in the TESS data,
providing an important new way to characterise troublesome systematics in
photometric data-sets. This paper represents the first stage of the wider
YOUNGSTER program, which will use a machine-learning-based approach to
classification and targeted detrending of young stars in order to improve the
recovery of smaller young exoplanets.",2022-01-31T19:00:11Z
"Deducing Neutron Star Equation of State Parameters Directly From
  Telescope Spectra with Uncertainty-Aware Machine Learning","Neutron stars provide a unique laboratory for studying matter at extreme
pressures and densities. While there is no direct way to explore their interior
structure, X-rays emitted from these stars can indirectly provide clues to the
equation of state (EOS) of superdense nuclear matter through the inference of
the star's mass and radius. However, inference of EOS directly from a star's
X-ray spectra is extremely challenging and is complicated by systematic
uncertainties. The current state of the art is to use simulation-based
likelihoods in a piece-wise method, which first infer the star's mass and
radius to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, and from those quantities
infer the EOS. We demonstrate a series of enhancements to the state of the art,
in terms of realistic uncertainty quantification and improved regression of
physical properties with machine learning. We also demonstrate novel inference
of the EOS directly from the high-dimensional spectra of observed stars,
avoiding the intermediate mass-radius step. Our network is conditioned on the
sources of uncertainty of each star, allowing for natural and complete
propagation of uncertainties to the EOS.",2022-09-06T21:12:55Z
"Machine Learning based search for Cataclysmic Variables within Gaia
  Science Alerts","Wide-field time domain facilities detect transient events in large numbers
through difference imaging. For example, Zwicky Transient Facility produces
alerts for hundreds of thousands of transient events per night, a rate set to
be dwarfed by the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory. The automation provided by
Machine Learning (ML) is, therefore, necessary to classify these events and
select the most interesting sources for follow-up observations. Cataclysmic
Variables (CVs) are a transient class that are numerous, bright, and nearby,
providing excellent laboratories for the study of accretion and binary
evolution. Here we focus on our use of ML to identify CVs from photometric data
of transient sources published by the Gaia Science Alerts program (GSA) - a
large, easily accessible resource, not fully explored with ML. The use of light
curve feature extraction techniques and source metadata from the Gaia survey
resulted in a Random Forest model capable of distinguishing CVs from
supernovae, Active Galactic Nuclei, and Young Stellar Objects with a 92\%
precision score and an 85\% hit rate. Of 13,280 sources within GSA without an
assigned transient classification our model predicts the CV class for
$\sim$2800. Spectroscopic observations are underway to classify a statistically
significant sample of these targets to validate the performance of the model.
This work puts us on a path towards the classification of rare CV subtypes from
future wide-field surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.",2022-10-04T07:40:28Z
"Population of X-ray Sources in the Intermediate-Age Cluster NGC 3532: a
  Test Bed for Machine-Learning Classification","Open clusters are thought to be the birth place of most stars in the Galaxy.
Thus, they are excellent laboratories for investigating stellar evolution, and
X-ray properties of various types of stars (including binary stars, evolved
stars, and compact objects). In this work, we investigate the population of
X-ray sources in the nearby 300-Myr-old open cluster NGC 3532 using Chandra
X-ray Observatory and multi-wavelength data from several surveys. We apply a
random-forest machine-learning pipeline (MUWCLASS) to classify all confidently
detected X-ray sources (S/N$>5$) in the field of NGC 3532. We also perform a
more detailed investigation of brighter sources, including their X-ray spectra
and lightcurves. Most X-ray sources are confirmed as coronally-active low-mass
stars, many of which are confidently identified by MUWCLASS. Several late B or
early A-type \textbf{stars} are relatively bright in X-rays, most of which are
likely binaries. We do not find any compact objects among X-ray sources
reliably associated with NGC 3532, down to the limiting X-ray flux of $\sim
2\times10^{-15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, corresponding to $L_X\sim 6\times
10^{28}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at the cluster's distance. We also identify several
Galactic sources beyond NGC 3532 that differ from typical coronally active
stars, and were classified by MUWCLASS as potential compact objects. Detailed
investigation reveals that these sources may indeed belong to rarer classes,
and deserve follow up observations.",2022-12-26T23:29:04Z
A catalog of nearby accelerating star candidates in Gaia DR3,"We describe a new catalog of accelerating star candidates with Gaia $G\le
17.5$ mag and distances $d\le 100$ pc. Designated as Gaia Nearby Accelerating
Star Catalog (GNASC), it contains 29,684 members identified using a supervised
machine-learning algorithm trained on the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of
Accelerations (HGCA), Gaia Data Release 2, and Gaia Early Data Release 3. We
take advantage of the difference in observation timelines of the two Gaia
catalogs and information about the quality of the astrometric modeling based on
the premise that acceleration will correlate with astrometric uncertainties.
Catalog membership is based on whether constant proper motion over three
decades can be ruled out at high confidence (greater than 99.9%). Test data
suggest that catalog members each have a 68% likelihood of true astrometric
acceleration; subsets of the catalog perform even better, with the likelihood
exceeding 85%. We compare the GNASC with Gaia Data Release 3 and its table of
stars for which acceleration is detected at high confidence based on precise
astrometric fits. Our catalog, derived without this information, captured over
96% of sources in the table that meet our selection criteria. In addition, the
GNASC contains bright, nearby candidates that were not in the original
Hipparcos survey, including members of known binary systems as well as stars
with companions yet to be identified. It thus extends the HGCA and demonstrates
the potential of the machine-learning approach to discover hidden partners of
nearby stars in future astrometric surveys.",2023-03-17T01:10:26Z
Heating and dynamics of the Solar atmosphere,"The solar atmosphere shows anomalous variation in temperature, starting from
the 5500 K photosphere to the million-degree Kelvin corona. The corona itself
expands into the interstellar medium as the free streaming solar wind, which
modulates and impacts the near-Earth space weather. The precise source regions
of different structures in the solar wind, their formation height, and the
heating of the solar atmosphere are inextricably linked and unsolved problems
in astrophysics. Observations suggest correlations between Coronal holes (CHs),
which are cool, intensity deficit structures in the solar corona, with
structures in the solar wind. Observations also suggest the local plasma
heating in the corona through power-law distributed impulsive events. In this
thesis, we use narrowband photometric, spectroscopic, and disc-integrated
emission of the solar atmosphere ranging from Near Ultraviolet to X-rays along
with in-situ solar wind measurements to understand (i). the source regions of
the solar wind, (ii). the underlying mechanism of solar coronal heating, and
(iii). the differentiation in dynamics of CHs with the background Quiet Sun
(QS) regions, which do not show any significant signature of the solar wind. We
leverage machine learning and numerical modeling tools to develop solar wind
forecasting codes using interpretable AI, inversion codes to infer the
properties of impulsive events and to understand the differences in the
thermodynamics of CHs and QS regions. We finally present a unified scenario of
solar wind emergence and heating in the solar atmosphere and discuss the
implications of inferences from this thesis.",2023-04-04T06:13:07Z
Interpretable machine learning for finding intermediate-mass black holes,"Definitive evidence that globular clusters (GCs) host intermediate-mass black
holes (IMBHs) is elusive. Machine learning (ML) models trained on GC
simulations can in principle predict IMBH host candidates based on observable
features. This approach has two limitations: first, an accurate ML model is
expected to be a black box due to complexity; second, despite our efforts to
realistically simulate GCs, the simulation physics or initial conditions may
fail to fully reflect reality. Therefore our training data may be biased,
leading to a failure in generalization on observational data. Both the first
issue -- explainability/interpretability -- and the second -- out of
distribution generalization and fairness -- are active areas of research in ML.
Here we employ techniques from these fields to address them: we use the anchors
method to explain an XGBoost classifier; we also independently train a natively
interpretable model using Certifiably Optimal RulE ListS (CORELS). The
resulting model has a clear physical meaning, but loses some performance with
respect to XGBoost. We evaluate potential candidates in real data based not
only on classifier predictions but also on their similarity to the training
data, measured by the likelihood of a kernel density estimation model. This
measures the realism of our simulated data and mitigates the risk that our
models may produce biased predictions by working in extrapolation. We apply our
classifiers to real GCs, obtaining a predicted classification, a measure of the
confidence of the prediction, an out-of-distribution flag, a local rule
explaining the prediction of XGBoost and a global rule from CORELS.",2023-10-28T02:15:09Z
Stellar Atmospheric Parameters for Cool Dwarfs in Gaia DR3,"We provide a catalogue of atmospheric parameters for 1,806,921 cool dwarfs
from Gaia DR3 which lie within the range covered by LAMOST cool dwarf
spectroscopic parameters: 3200 K < T_{eff}< 4300 K, -0.8 < [M/H] < 0.2 dex, and
4.5 <log{g} < 5.5 dex. Our values are derived based on Machine Learning models
trained with multi-band photometry corrected for dust. The photometric data
comprises of optical from SDSS r, i, z bands, near-infrared from 2MASS J, H, K
and mid-infrared from ALLWISE W1, W2. We used both random forest and LightGBM
machine learning models and found similar results from both with an error
dispersion of 68 K, 0.22 dex, and 0.05 dex for T_{eff}, [M/H], and log {g},
respectively. Assessment of the relative feature importance of different
photometric colors indicated W1 -- W2 as most sensitive to both T_{eff} and
log{g}, with J -- H most sensitive to [M/H]. We find that our values show a
good agreement with APOGEE, but are significantly different to those provided
as part of Gaia DR3.",2023-11-15T13:29:05Z
"Machine Learning applications for Cataclysmic Variable discovery in the
  ZTF alert stream","Cataclysmic variables (CV) encompass a diverse array of accreting white dwarf
binary systems. Each class of CV represents a snapshot along an evolutionary
journey, one with the potential to trigger a type Ia supernova event. The study
of CVs offers valuable insights into binary evolution and accretion physics,
with the rarest examples potentially providing the deepest insights. However,
the escalating number of detected transients, coupled with our limited capacity
to investigate them all, poses challenges in identifying such rarities. Machine
Learning (ML) plays a pivotal role in addressing this issue by facilitating the
categorisation of each detected transient into its respective transient class.
Leveraging these techniques, we have developed a two-stage pipeline tailored to
the ZTF transient alert stream. The first stage is an alerts filter aimed at
removing non-CVs, while the latter is an ML classifier produced using XGBoost,
achieving a macro average AUC score of 0.92 for distinguishing between CV
classes. By utilising the Generative Topographic Mapping algorithm with
classifier posterior probabilities as input, we obtain representations
indicating that CV evolutionary factors play a role in classifier performance,
while the associated feature maps present a potent tool for identifying the
features deemed most relevant for distinguishing between classes.
Implementation of the pipeline in June 2023 yielded 51 intriguing candidates
that are yet to be reported as CVs or classified with further granularity. Our
classifier represents a significant step in the discovery and classification of
different CV classes, a domain of research still in its infancy.",2023-12-09T09:30:52Z
"Stellar Spectra Fitting with Amortized Neural Posterior Estimation and
  nbi","Modern surveys often deliver hundreds of thousands of stellar spectra at
once, which are fit to spectral models to derive stellar parameters/labels.
Therefore, the technique of Amortized Neural Posterior Estimation (ANPE) stands
out as a suitable approach, which enables the inference of large number of
targets as sub-linear/constant computational costs. Leveraging our new nbi
software package, we train an ANPE model for the APOGEE survey and demonstrate
its efficacy on both mock and real APOGEE stellar spectra. Unique to the nbi
package is its out-of-the-box functionality on astronomical inverse problems
with sequential data. As such, we have been able to acquire the trained model
with minimal effort. We introduce an effective approach to handling the
measurement noise properties inherent in spectral data, which utilizes the
actual uncertainties in the observed data. This allows training data to
resemble observed data, an aspect that is crucial for ANPE applications. Given
the association of spectral data properties with the observing instrument, we
discuss the utility of an ANPE ""model zoo,"" where models are trained for
specific instruments and distributed under the nbi framework to facilitate
real-time stellar parameter inference.",2023-12-09T21:30:07Z
"Newton vs the machine: solving the chaotic three-body problem using deep
  neural networks","Since its formulation by Sir Isaac Newton, the problem of solving the
equations of motion for three bodies under their own gravitational force has
remained practically unsolved. Currently, the solution for a given
initialization can only be found by performing laborious iterative calculations
that have unpredictable and potentially infinite computational cost, due to the
system's chaotic nature. We show that an ensemble of solutions obtained using
an arbitrarily precise numerical integrator can be used to train a deep
artificial neural network (ANN) that, over a bounded time interval, provides
accurate solutions at fixed computational cost and up to 100 million times
faster than a state-of-the-art solver. Our results provide evidence that, for
computationally challenging regions of phase-space, a trained ANN can replace
existing numerical solvers, enabling fast and scalable simulations of many-body
systems to shed light on outstanding phenomena such as the formation of
black-hole binary systems or the origin of the core collapse in dense star
clusters.",2019-10-16T11:31:18Z
"Identification of Young Stellar Object candidates in the $Gaia$ DR2 x
  AllWISE catalogue with machine learning methods","The second $Gaia$ Data Release (DR2) contains astrometric and photometric
data for more than 1.6 billion objects with mean $Gaia$ $G$ magnitude $<$20.7,
including many Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) in different evolutionary stages.
In order to explore the YSO population of the Milky Way, we combined the $Gaia$
DR2 database with WISE and Planck measurements and made an all-sky
probabilistic catalogue of YSOs using machine learning techniques, such as
Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, or Neural Networks. Our input
catalogue contains 103 million objects from the DR2xAllWISE cross-match table.
We classified each object into four main classes: YSOs, extragalactic objects,
main-sequence stars and evolved stars. At a 90% probability threshold we
identified 1,129,295 YSO candidates. To demonstrate the quality and potential
of our YSO catalogue, here we present two applications of it. (1) We explore
the 3D structure of the Orion A star forming complex and show that the spatial
distribution of the YSOs classified by our procedure is in agreement with
recent results from the literature. (2) We use our catalogue to classify
published $Gaia$ Science Alerts. As $Gaia$ measures the sources at multiple
epochs, it can efficiently discover transient events, including sudden
brightness changes of YSOs caused by dynamic processes of their circumstellar
disk. However, in many cases the physical nature of the published alert sources
are not known. A cross-check with our new catalogue shows that about 30% more
of the published $Gaia$ alerts can most likely be attributed to YSO activity.
The catalogue can be also useful to identify YSOs among future $Gaia$ alerts.",2019-05-08T13:23:14Z
"Photometric Classifications of Evolved Massive Stars: Preparing for the
  Era of Webb and Roman with Machine Learning","In the coming years, next-generation space-based infrared observatories will
significantly increase our samples of rare massive stars, representing a
tremendous opportunity to leverage modern statistical tools and methods to test
massive stellar evolution in entirely new environments. Such work is only
possible if the observed objects can be reliably classified. Spectroscopic
observations are infeasible with more distant targets, and so we wish to
determine whether machine learning methods can classify massive stars using
broadband infrared photometry. We find that a Support Vector Machine classifier
is capable of coarsely classifying massive stars with labels corresponding to
hot, cool, and emission line stars with high accuracy, while rejecting
contaminating low mass giants. Remarkably, 76\% of emission line stars can be
recovered without the need for narrowband or spectroscopic observations. We
classify a sample of ${\sim}2500$ objects with no existing labels, and identify
fourteen candidate emission line objects. Unfortunately, despite the high
precision of the photometry in our sample, the heterogeneous origins of the
labels for the stars in our sample severely inhibits our classifier from
distinguishing classes of stars with more granularity. Ultimately, no large and
homogeneously labeled sample of massive stars currently exists. Without
significant efforts to robustly classify evolved massive stars -- which is
feasible given existing data from large all-sky spectroscopic surveys --
shortcomings in the labeling of existing data sets will hinder efforts to
leverage the next-generation of space observatories.",2021-02-04T19:00:01Z
"Challenges with Extreme Class-Imbalance and Temporal Coherence: A Study
  on Solar Flare Data","In analyses of rare-events, regardless of the domain of application,
class-imbalance issue is intrinsic. Although the challenges are known to data
experts, their explicit impact on the analytic and the decisions made based on
the findings are often overlooked. This is in particular prevalent in
interdisciplinary research where the theoretical aspects are sometimes
overshadowed by the challenges of the application. To show-case these
undesirable impacts, we conduct a series of experiments on a recently created
benchmark data, named Space Weather ANalytics for Solar Flares (SWAN-SF). This
is a multivariate time series dataset of magnetic parameters of active regions.
As a remedy for the imbalance issue, we study the impact of data manipulation
(undersampling and oversampling) and model manipulation (using class weights).
Furthermore, we bring to focus the auto-correlation of time series that is
inherited from the use of sliding window for monitoring flares' history.
Temporal coherence, as we call this phenomenon, invalidates the randomness
assumption, thus impacting all sampling practices including different
cross-validation techniques. We illustrate how failing to notice this concept
could give an artificial boost in the forecast performance and result in
misleading findings. Throughout this study we utilized Support Vector Machine
as a classifier, and True Skill Statistics as a verification metric for
comparison of experiments. We conclude our work by specifying the correct
practice in each case, and we hope that this study could benefit researchers in
other domains where time series of rare events are of interest.",2019-11-20T17:46:38Z
"Solving higher-order Lane-Emden-Fowler type equations using
  physics-informed neural networks: benchmark tests comparing soft and hard
  constraints","In this paper, numerical methods using Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) are presented with the aim to solve higher-order ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). Indeed, this deep-learning technique is successfully applied
for solving different classes of singular ODEs, namely the well known
second-order Lane-Emden equations, third order-order Emden-Fowler equations,
and fourth-order Lane-Emden-Fowler equations. Two variants of PINNs technique
are considered and compared. First, a minimization procedure is used to
constrain the total loss function of the neural network, in which the equation
residual is considered with some weight to form a physics-based loss and added
to the training data loss that contains the initial/boundary conditions.
Second, a specific choice of trial solutions ensuring these conditions as hard
constraints is done in order to satisfy the differential equation, contrary to
the first variant based on training data where the constraints appear as soft
ones. Advantages and drawbacks of PINNs variants are highlighted.",2023-07-14T12:27:05Z
Neural Operator for Accelerating Coronal Magnetic Field Model,"Studying the sun's outer atmosphere is challenging due to its complex
magnetic fields impacting solar activities. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
simulations help model these interactions but are extremely time-consuming
(usually on a scale of days). Our research applies the Fourier Neural Operator
(FNO) to accelerate the coronal magnetic field modeling, specifically, the
Bifrost MHD model. We apply Tensorized FNO (TFNO) to generate solutions from
partial differential equations (PDEs) over a 3D domain efficiently. TFNO's
performance is compared with other deep learning methods, highlighting its
accuracy and scalability. Physics analysis confirms that TFNO is reliable and
capable of accelerating MHD simulations with high precision. This advancement
improves efficiency in data handling, enhances predictive capabilities, and
provides a better understanding of magnetic topologies.",2024-05-21T13:04:53Z
"Extreme Solar Flare Prediction Using Residual Networks with HMI
  Magnetograms and Intensitygrams","Solar flares, especially C, M, and X class, pose significant risks to
satellite operations, communication systems, and power grids. We present a
novel approach for predicting extreme solar flares using HMI intensitygrams and
magnetograms. By detecting sunspots from intensitygrams and extracting magnetic
field patches from magnetograms, we train a Residual Network (ResNet) to
classify extreme class flares. Our model demonstrates high accuracy, offering a
robust tool for predicting extreme solar flares and improving space weather
forecasting. Additionally, we show that HMI magnetograms provide more useful
data for deep learning compared to other SDO AIA images by better capturing
features critical for predicting flare magnitudes. This study underscores the
importance of identifying magnetic fields in solar flare prediction, marking a
significant advancement in solar activity prediction with practical
implications for mitigating space weather impacts.",2024-05-23T16:17:16Z
Magnetogram-to-Magnetogram: Generative Forecasting of Solar Evolution,"Investigating the solar magnetic field is crucial to understand the physical
processes in the solar interior as well as their effects on the interplanetary
environment. We introduce a novel method to predict the evolution of the solar
line-of-sight (LoS) magnetogram using image-to-image translation with Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). Our approach combines ""computer science
metrics"" for image quality and ""physics metrics"" for physical accuracy to
evaluate model performance. The results indicate that DDPMs are effective in
maintaining the structural integrity, the dynamic range of solar magnetic
fields, the magnetic flux and other physical features such as the size of the
active regions, surpassing traditional persistence models, also in flaring
situation. We aim to use deep learning not only for visualisation but as an
integrative and interactive tool for telescopes, enhancing our understanding of
unexpected physical events like solar flares. Future studies will aim to
integrate more diverse solar data to refine the accuracy and applicability of
our generative model.",2024-07-16T12:28:10Z
"Identifying Exoplanets with Deep Learning II: Two New Super-Earths
  Uncovered by a Neural Network in K2 Data","For years, scientists have used data from NASA's Kepler Space Telescope to
look for and discover thousands of transiting exoplanets. In its extended K2
mission, Kepler observed stars in various regions of sky all across the
ecliptic plane, and therefore in different galactic environments. Astronomers
want to learn how the population of exoplanets are different in these different
environments. However, this requires an automatic and unbiased way to identify
the exoplanets in these regions and rule out false positive signals that mimic
transiting planet signals. We present a method for classifying these exoplanet
signals using deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms that have
become popular in fields ranging from medical science to linguistics. We
modified a neural network previously used to identify exoplanets in the Kepler
field to be able to identify exoplanets in different K2 campaigns, which range
in galactic environments. We train a convolutional neural network, called
AstroNet-K2, to predict whether a given possible exoplanet signal is really
caused by an exoplanet or a false positive. AstroNet-K2 is highly successful at
classifying exoplanets and false positives, with accuracy of 98% on our test
set. It is especially efficient at identifying and culling false positives, but
for now, still needs human supervision to create a complete and reliable planet
candidate sample. We use AstroNet-K2 to identify and validate two previously
unknown exoplanets. Our method is a step towards automatically identifying new
exoplanets in K2 data and learning how exoplanet populations depend on their
galactic birthplace.",2019-03-25T18:00:00Z
"The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs -- A deep transfer
  learning method to determine Teff and [M/H] of target stars","The large amounts of astrophysical data being provided by existing and future
instrumentation require efficient and fast analysis tools. Transfer learning is
a new technique promising higher accuracy in the derived data products, with
information from one domain being transferred to improve the accuracy of a
neural network model in another domain. In this work, we demonstrate the
feasibility of applying the deep transfer learning (DTL) approach to
high-resolution spectra in the framework of photospheric stellar parameter
determination. To this end, we used 14 stars of the CARMENES survey sample with
interferometric angular diameters to calculate the effective temperature, as
well as six M dwarfs that are common proper motion companions to FGK-type
primaries with known metallicity. After training a deep learning (DL) neural
network model on synthetic PHOENIX-ACES spectra, we used the internal feature
representations together with those 14+6 stars with independent parameter
measurements as a new input for the transfer process. We compare the derived
stellar parameters of a small sample of M dwarfs kept out of the training phase
with results from other methods in the literature. Assuming that temperatures
from bolometric luminosities and interferometric radii and metallicities from
FGK+M binaries are sufficiently accurate, DTL provides a higher accuracy than
our previous state-of-the-art DL method (mean absolute differences improve by
20 K for temperature and 0.2 dex for metallicity from DL to DTL when compared
with reference values from interferometry and FGK+M binaries). Furthermore, the
machine learning (internal) precision of DTL also improves as uncertainties are
five times smaller on average. These results indicate that DTL is a robust tool
for obtaining M-dwarf stellar parameters comparable to those obtained from
independent estimations for well-known stars.",2023-04-01T04:57:09Z
"Using autoencoders and deep transfer learning to determine the stellar
  parameters of 286 CARMENES M dwarfs","Deep learning (DL) techniques are a promising approach among the set of
methods used in the ever-challenging determination of stellar parameters in M
dwarfs. In this context, transfer learning could play an important role in
mitigating uncertainties in the results due to the synthetic gap (i.e.
difference in feature distributions between observed and synthetic data). We
propose a feature-based deep transfer learning (DTL) approach based on
autoencoders to determine stellar parameters from high-resolution spectra.
Using this methodology, we provide new estimations for the effective
temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and projected rotational velocity
for 286 M dwarfs observed by the CARMENES survey. Using autoencoder
architectures, we projected synthetic PHOENIX-ACES spectra and observed
CARMENES spectra onto a new feature space of lower dimensionality in which the
differences between the two domains are reduced. We used this low-dimensional
new feature space as input for a convolutional neural network to obtain the
stellar parameter determinations. We performed an extensive analysis of our
estimated stellar parameters, ranging from 3050 to 4300 K, 4.7 to 5.1 dex, and
-0.53 to 0.25 dex for Teff, logg, and [Fe/H], respectively. Our results are
broadly consistent with those of recent studies using CARMENES data, with a
systematic deviation in our Teff scale towards hotter values for estimations
above 3750 K. Furthermore, our methodology mitigates the deviations in
metallicity found in previous DL techniques due to the synthetic gap. We
consolidated a DTL-based methodology to determine stellar parameters in M
dwarfs from synthetic spectra, with no need for high-quality measurements
involved in the knowledge transfer. These results suggest the great potential
of DTL to mitigate the differences in feature distributions between the
observations and the PHOENIX-ACES spectra.",2024-05-14T15:42:27Z
"Exploring the Limits of Synthetic Creation of Solar EUV Images via
  Image-to-Image Translation","The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), a NASA multi-spectral decade-long
mission that has been daily producing terabytes of observational data from the
Sun, has been recently used as a use-case to demonstrate the potential of
machine learning methodologies and to pave the way for future deep-space
mission planning. In particular, the idea of using image-to-image translation
to virtually produce extreme ultra-violet channels has been proposed in several
recent studies, as a way to both enhance missions with less available channels
and to alleviate the challenges due to the low downlink rate in deep space.
This paper investigates the potential and the limitations of such a deep
learning approach by focusing on the permutation of four channels and an
encoder--decoder based architecture, with particular attention to how
morphological traits and brightness of the solar surface affect the neural
network predictions. In this work we want to answer the question: can synthetic
images of the solar corona produced via image-to-image translation be used for
scientific studies of the Sun? The analysis highlights that the neural network
produces high-quality images over three orders of magnitude in count rate
(pixel intensity) and can generally reproduce the covariance across channels
within a 1% error. However the model performance drastically diminishes in
correspondence of extremely high energetic events like flares, and we argue
that the reason is related to the rareness of such events posing a challenge to
model training.",2022-08-19T18:58:36Z
Disentangled Representation Learning for Astronomical Chemical Tagging,"Modern astronomical surveys are observing spectral data for millions of
stars. These spectra contain chemical information that can be used to trace the
Galaxy's formation and chemical enrichment history. However, extracting the
information from spectra, and making precise and accurate chemical abundance
measurements are challenging. Here, we present a data-driven method for
isolating the chemical factors of variation in stellar spectra from those of
other parameters (i.e. \teff, \logg, \feh). This enables us to build a spectral
projection for each star with these parameters removed. We do this with no ab
initio knowledge of elemental abundances themselves, and hence bypass the
uncertainties and systematics associated with modeling that rely on synthetic
stellar spectra. To remove known non-chemical factors of variation, we develop
and implement a neural network architecture that learns a disentangled spectral
representation. We simulate our recovery of chemically identical stars using
the disentangled spectra in a synthetic APOGEE-like dataset. We show that this
recovery declines as a function of the signal to noise ratio, but that our
neural network architecture outperforms simpler modeling choices. Our work
demonstrates the feasibility of data-driven abundance-free chemical tagging.",2021-03-10T22:55:44Z
"Automatic classification of eclipsing binary stars using deep learning
  methods","In the last couple of decades, tremendous progress has been achieved in
developing robotic telescopes and, as a result, sky surveys (both terrestrial
and space) have become the source of a substantial amount of new observational
data. These data contain a lot of information about binary stars, hidden in
their light curves. With the huge amount of astronomical data gathered, it is
not reasonable to expect all the data to be manually processed and analyzed.
Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the automatic classification of eclipsing
binary stars using deep learning methods. Our classifier provides a tool for
the categorization of light curves of binary stars into two classes: detached
and over-contact. We used the ELISa software to obtain synthetic data, which we
then used for the training of the classifier. For evaluation purposes, we
collected 100 light curves of observed binary stars, in order to evaluate a
number of classifiers. We evaluated semi-detached eclipsing binary stars as
detached. The best-performing classifier combines bidirectional Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, which
achieved 98% accuracy on the evaluation set. Omitting semi-detached eclipsing
binary stars, we could obtain 100% accuracy in classification.",2021-08-03T17:28:03Z
"Solar synthetic imaging: Introducing denoising diffusion probabilistic
  models on SDO/AIA data","Given the rarity of significant solar flares compared to smaller ones,
training effective machine learning models for solar activity forecasting is
challenging due to insufficient data. This study proposes using generative deep
learning models, specifically a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM),
to create synthetic images of solar phenomena, including flares of varying
intensities. By employing a dataset from the AIA instrument aboard the SDO
spacecraft, focusing on the 171 {\AA} band that captures various solar
activities, and classifying images with GOES X-ray measurements based on flare
intensity, we aim to address the data scarcity issue. The DDPM's performance is
evaluated using cluster metrics, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and
F1-score, showcasing promising results in generating realistic solar imagery.
We conduct two experiments: one to train a supervised classifier for event
identification and another for basic flare prediction, demonstrating the value
of synthetic data in managing imbalanced datasets. This research underscores
the potential of DDPMs in solar data analysis and forecasting, suggesting
further exploration into their capabilities for solar flare prediction and
application in other deep learning and physical tasks.",2024-04-03T08:18:45Z
"Exploring Deep Learning for Full-disk Solar Flare Prediction with
  Empirical Insights from Guided Grad-CAM Explanations","This study progresses solar flare prediction research by presenting a
full-disk deep-learning model to forecast $\geq$M-class solar flares and
evaluating its efficacy on both central (within $\pm$70$^\circ$) and near-limb
(beyond $\pm$70$^\circ$) events, showcasing qualitative assessment of post hoc
explanations for the model's predictions, and providing empirical findings from
human-centered quantitative assessments of these explanations. Our model is
trained using hourly full-disk line-of-sight magnetogram images to predict
$\geq$M-class solar flares within the subsequent 24-hour prediction window.
Additionally, we apply the Guided Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
(Guided Grad-CAM) attribution method to interpret our model's predictions and
evaluate the explanations. Our analysis unveils that full-disk solar flare
predictions correspond with active region characteristics. The following points
represent the most important findings of our study: (1) Our deep learning
models achieved an average true skill statistic (TSS) of $\sim$0.51 and a
Heidke skill score (HSS) of $\sim$0.38, exhibiting skill to predict solar
flares where for central locations the average recall is $\sim$0.75 (recall
values for X- and M-class are 0.95 and 0.73 respectively) and for the near-limb
flares the average recall is $\sim$0.52 (recall values for X- and M-class are
0.74 and 0.50 respectively); (2) qualitative examination of the model's
explanations reveals that it discerns and leverages features linked to active
regions in both central and near-limb locations within full-disk magnetograms
to produce respective predictions. In essence, our models grasp the shape and
texture-based properties of flaring active regions, even in proximity to limb
areas -- a novel and essential capability with considerable significance for
operational forecasting systems.",2023-08-30T02:24:09Z
Estimating Extinction using Unsupervised Machine Learning,"Dust extinction is the most robust tracer of the gas distribution in the
interstellar medium, but measuring extinction is limited by the systematic
uncertainties involved in estimating the intrinsic colors to background stars.
In this paper we present a new technique, PNICER, that estimates intrinsic
colors and extinction for individual stars using unsupervised machine learning
algorithms. This new method aims to be free from any priors with respect to the
column density and intrinsic color distribution. It is applicable to any
combination of parameters and works in arbitrary numbers of dimensions.
Furthermore, it is not restricted to color space. Extinction towards single
sources is determined by fitting Gaussian Mixture Models along the extinction
vector to (extinction-free) control field observations. In this way it becomes
possible to describe the extinction for observed sources with probability
densities. PNICER effectively eliminates known biases found in similar methods
and outperforms them in cases of deep observational data where the number of
background galaxies is significant, or when a large number of parameters is
used to break degeneracies in the intrinsic color distributions. This new
method remains computationally competitive, making it possible to correctly
de-redden millions of sources within a matter of seconds. With the
ever-increasing number of large-scale high-sensitivity imaging surveys, PNICER
offers a fast and reliable way to efficiently calculate extinction for
arbitrary parameter combinations without prior information on source
characteristics. PNICER also offers access to the well-established NICER
technique in a simple unified interface and is capable of building extinction
maps including the NICEST correction for cloud substructure. PNICER is offered
to the community as an open-source software solution and is entirely written in
Python.",2017-02-27T19:00:00Z
"Catalogue of new Herbig Ae/Be and classical Be stars. A machine learning
  approach to Gaia DR2","The intermediate-mass pre-main sequence Herbig Ae/Be stars are key to
understanding the differences in formation mechanisms between low- and
high-mass stars. The study of the general properties of these objects is
hampered by the fact that few and mostly serendipitously discovered sources are
known. Our goal is to identify new Herbig Ae/Be candidates to create a
homogeneous and well defined catalogue of these objects. We have applied
machine learning techniques to 4,150,983 sources with data from Gaia DR2,
2MASS, WISE, and IPHAS or VPHAS+. Several observables were chosen to identify
new Herbig Ae/Be candidates based on our current knowledge of this class, which
is characterised by infrared excesses, photometric variabilities, and H$\alpha$
emission lines. Classical techniques are not efficient for identifying new
Herbig Ae/Be stars mainly because of their similarity with classical Be stars,
with which they share many characteristics. By focusing on disentangling these
two types of objects, our algorithm has also identified new classical Be stars.
We have obtained a large catalogue of 8470 new pre-main sequence candidates and
another catalogue of 693 new classical Be candidates with a completeness of
$78.8\pm1.4\%$ and $85.5\pm1.2\%$, respectively. Of the catalogue of pre-main
sequence candidates, at least 1361 sources are potentially new Herbig Ae/Be
candidates according to their position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. In
this study we present the methodology used, evaluate the quality of the
catalogues, and perform an analysis of their flaws and biases. For this
assessment, we make use of observables that have not been accounted for by the
algorithm and hence are selection-independent, such as coordinates and parallax
based distances. The catalogue of new Herbig Ae/Be stars that we present here
increases the number of known objects of the class by an order of magnitude.",2020-05-04T18:00:02Z
"Classification of Periodic Variable Stars with Novel Cyclic-Permutation
  Invariant Neural Networks","Neural networks (NNs) have been shown to be competitive against
state-of-the-art feature engineering and random forest (RF) classification of
periodic variable stars. Although previous work utilising NNs has made use of
periodicity by period folding multiple-cycle time-series into a single cycle --
from time-space to phase-space -- no approach to date has taken advantage of
the fact that network predictions should be invariant to the initial phase of
the period-folded sequence. Initial phase is exogenous to the physical origin
of the variability and should thus be factored out. Here, we present
cyclic-permutation invariant networks, a novel class of NNs for which
invariance to phase shifts is guaranteed through polar coordinate convolutions,
which we implement by means of ""Symmetry Padding."" Across three different
datasets of variable star light curves, we show that two implementations of the
cyclic-permutation invariant network: the iTCN and the iResNet, consistently
outperform non-invariant baselines and reduce overall error rates by between 4%
to 22%. Over a 10-class OGLE-III sample, the iTCN/iResNet achieves an average
per-class accuracy of 93.4%/93.3%, compared to RNN/RF accuracies of 70.5%/89.5%
in a recent study using the same data. Finding improvement on a non-astronomy
benchmark, we suggest that the methodology introduced here should also be
applicable to a wide range of science domains where periodic data abounds due
to physical symmetries.",2020-11-02T19:00:01Z
"Automated Classification of Periodic Variable Stars detected by the
  Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer","We describe a methodology to classify periodic variable stars identified
using photometric time-series measurements constructed from the Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) full-mission single-exposure Source Databases.
This will assist in the future construction of a WISE Variable Source Database
that assigns variables to specific science classes as constrained by the WISE
observing cadence with statistically meaningful classification probabilities.
We have analyzed the WISE light curves of 8273 variable stars identified in
previous optical variability surveys (MACHO, GCVS, and ASAS) and show that
Fourier decomposition techniques can be extended into the mid-IR to assist with
their classification. Combined with other periodic light-curve features, this
sample is then used to train a machine-learned classifier based on the random
forest (RF) method. Consistent with previous classification studies of variable
stars in general, the RF machine-learned classifier is superior to other
methods in terms of accuracy, robustness against outliers, and relative
immunity to features that carry little or redundant class information. For the
three most common classes identified by WISE: Algols, RR Lyrae, and W Ursae
Majoris type variables, we obtain classification efficiencies of 80.7%, 82.7%,
and 84.5% respectively using cross-validation analyses, with 95% confidence
intervals of approximately +/-2%. These accuracies are achieved at purity (or
reliability) levels of 88.5%, 96.2%, and 87.8% respectively, similar to that
achieved in previous automated classification studies of periodic variable
stars.",2014-02-01T21:23:38Z
"Decoding Starlight with Big Survey Data, Machine Learning, and
  Cosmological Simulations","Stars, and collections of stars, encode rich signatures of stellar physics
and galaxy evolution. With properties influenced by both their environment and
intrinsic nature, stars retain information about astrophysical phenomena that
are not otherwise directly observable. In the time-domain, the observed
brightness variability of a star can be used to investigate physical processes
occurring at the stellar surface and in the stellar interior. On a galactic
scale, the properties of stars, including chemical abundances and stellar ages,
serve as a multi-dimensional record of the origin of the galaxy. In the Milky
Way, together with orbital properties, this informs the details of the
evolution of our Galaxy since its formation. Extending beyond the Local Group,
the attributes of unresolved stellar populations allow us to study the
diversity of galaxies in the Universe.
  By examining the properties of stars, and how they vary across a range of
spatial and temporal scales, this Dissertation connects the information
residing within stars to global processes in galactic formation and evolution.
We develop new approaches to determine stellar properties, including rotation
and surface gravity, from the variability that we directly observe. We offer
new insight into the chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way, tracing
different stellar explosions that capture billions of years of evolution. We
advance knowledge and understanding of how stars and galaxies are linked, by
examining differences in the initial stellar mass distributions comprising
galaxies, as they form. In building up this knowledge, we highlight current
tensions between data and theory. By synthesizing numerical simulations, large
observational data sets, and machine learning techniques, this work makes
valuable methodological contributions to maximize insights from diverse
ensembles of current and future stellar observations.",2020-09-22T16:32:43Z
Vela Pulsar: Single Pulses Analysis with Machine Learning Techniques,"We study individual pulses of Vela (PSR\ B0833-45\,/\,J0835-4510) from daily
observations of over three hours (around 120,000 pulses per observation),
performed simultaneously with the two radio telescopes at the Argentine
Institute of Radioastronomy. We select 4 days of observations in January-March
2021 and study their statistical properties with machine learning techniques.
We first use density based DBSCAN clustering techniques, associating pulses
mainly by amplitudes, and find a correlation between higher amplitudes and
earlier arrival times. We also find a weaker (polarization dependent)
correlation with the mean width of the pulses. We identify clusters of the
so-called mini-giant pulses, with $\sim10\times$ the average pulse amplitude.
We then perform an independent study, with Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)
clustering techniques. We use Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) reconstruction of
the pulses to separate them clearly from the noise and select one of the days
of observation to train VAE and apply it to thre rest of the observations. We
use SOM to determine 4 clusters of pulses per day per radio telescope and
conclude that our main results are robust and self-consistent. These results
support models for emitting regions at different heights (separated each by
roughly a hundred km) in the pulsar magnetosphere. We also model the pulses
amplitude distribution with interstellar scintillation patterns at the
inter-pulses time-scale finding a characterizing exponent
$n_{\mathrm{ISS}}\sim7-10$. In the appendices we discuss independent checks of
hardware systematics with the simultaneous use of the two radio telescopes in
different one-polarization / two-polarizations configurations. We also provide
a detailed analysis of the processes of radio-interferences cleaning and
individual pulse folding.",2021-08-30T18:14:51Z
"A machine-learning photometric classifier for massive stars in nearby
  galaxies I. The method","(abridged) Mass loss is a key parameter in the evolution of massive stars,
with discrepancies between theory and observations and with unknown importance
of the episodic mass loss. To address this we need increased numbers of
classified sources stars spanning a range of metallicity environments. We aim
to remedy the situation by applying machine learning techniques to recently
available extensive photometric catalogs. We used IR/Spitzer and
optical/Pan-STARRS, with Gaia astrometric information, to compile a large
catalog of known massive stars in M31 and M33, which were grouped in Blue, Red,
Yellow, B[e] supergiants, Luminous Blue Variables, Wolf-Rayet, and background
galaxies. Due to the high imbalance, we implemented synthetic data generation
to populate the underrepresented classes and improve separation by
undersampling the majority class. We built an ensemble classifier using color
indices. The probabilities from Support Vector Classification, Random Forests,
and Multi-layer Perceptron were combined for the final classification. The
overall weighted balanced accuracy is ~83%, recovering Red supergiants at ~94%,
Blue/Yellow/B[e] supergiants and background galaxies at ~50-80%, Wolf-Rayets at
~45%, and Luminous Blue Variables at ~30%, mainly due to their small sample
sizes. The mixing of spectral types (no strict boundaries in their color
indices) complicates the classification. Independent application to IC 1613,
WLM, and Sextans A galaxies resulted in an overall lower accuracy of ~70%,
attributed to metallicity and extinction effects. The missing data imputation
was explored using simple replacement with mean values and an iterative
imputor, which proved more capable. We also found that r-i and y-[3.6] were the
most important features. Our method, although limited by the sampling of the
feature space, is efficient in classifying sources with missing data and at
lower metallicitites.",2022-03-15T17:53:00Z
Analysing the SEDs of protoplanetary disks with machine learning,"ABRIDGED. The analysis of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of
protoplanetary disks to determine their physical properties is known to be
highly degenerate. Hence, a Bayesian analysis is required to obtain parameter
uncertainties and degeneracies. The challenge here is computational speed, as
one radiative transfer model requires a couple of minutes to compute. We
performed a Bayesian analysis for 30 well-known protoplanetary disks to
determine their physical disk properties, including uncertainties and
degeneracies. To circumvent the computational cost problem, we created neural
networks (NNs) to emulate the SED generation process. We created two sets of
radiative transfer disk models to train and test two NNs that predict SEDs for
continuous and discontinuous disks. A Bayesian analysis was then performed on
30 protoplanetary disks with SED data collected by the DIANA project to
determine the posterior distributions of all parameters. We ran this analysis
twice, (i) with old distances and additional parameter constraints as used in a
previous study, to compare results, and (ii) with updated distances and free
choice of parameters to obtain homogeneous and unbiased model parameters. We
evaluated the uncertainties in the determination of physical disk parameters
from SED analysis, and detected and quantified the strongest degeneracies. The
NNs are able to predict SEDs within 1ms with uncertainties of about 5% compared
to the true SEDs obtained by the radiative transfer code. We find parameter
values and uncertainties that are significantly different from previous values
obtained by $\chi^2$ fitting. Comparing the global evidence for continuous and
discontinuous disks, we find that 26 out of 30 objects are better described by
disks that have two distinct radial zones. Also, we created an interactive tool
that instantly returns the SED predicted by our NNs for any parameter
combination.",2023-02-09T13:32:47Z
"Improving the Arrival Time Estimates of Coronal Mass Ejections by Using
  Magnetohydrodynamic Ensemble Modeling, Heliospheric Imager data, and Machine
  Learning","The arrival time prediction of Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is an area of
active research. Many methods with varying levels of complexity have been
developed to predict CME arrival. However, the mean absolute error (MAE) of
predictions remains above 12 hours, even with the increasing complexity of
methods. In this work we develop a new method for CME arrival time prediction
that uses magnetohydrodynamic simulations involving data-constrained
flux-rope-based CMEs, which are introduced in a data-driven solar wind
background. We found that, for 6 CMEs studied in this work, the MAE in arrival
time was ~8 hours. We further improved our arrival time predictions by using
ensemble modeling and comparing the ensemble solutions with STEREO-A&B
heliospheric imager data. This was done by using our simulations to create
synthetic J-maps. A machine learning (ML) method called the lasso regression
was used for this comparison. Using this approach, we could reduce the MAE to
~4 hours. Another ML method based on the neural networks (NNs) made it possible
to reduce the MAE to ~5 hours for the cases when HI data from both STEREO-A&B
were available. NNs are capable of providing similar MAE when only the STEREO-A
data is used. Our methods also resulted in very encouraging values of standard
deviation (precision) of arrival time. The methods discussed in this paper
demonstrate significant improvements in the CME arrival time predictions. Our
work highlights the importance of using ML techniques in combination with
data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic modeling to improve space weather
predictions.",2023-02-11T03:39:27Z
"Applied Machine-Learning Models to Identify Spectral Sub-Types of M
  Dwarfs from Photometric Surveys","M dwarfs are the most abundant stars in the Solar Neighborhood and they are
prime targets for searching for rocky planets in habitable zones. Consequently,
a detailed characterization of these stars is in demand. The spectral sub-type
is one of the parameters that is used for the characterization and it is
traditionally derived from the observed spectra. However, obtaining the spectra
of M dwarfs is expensive in terms of observation time and resources due to
their intrinsic faintness. We study the performance of four machine-learning
(ML) models: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Probabilistic Random
Forest (PRF), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), in identifying the spectral
sub-types of M dwarfs at a grand scale by deploying broadband photometry in the
optical and near-infrared. We trained the ML models by using the
spectroscopically identified M dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data
Release (SDSS) 7, together with their photometric colors that were derived from
the SDSS, Two-Micron All-Sky Survey, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer.
We found that the RF, PRF, and MLP give a comparable prediction accuracy, 74%,
while the KNN provides slightly lower accuracy, 71%. We also found that these
models can predict the spectral sub-type of M dwarfs with ~99% accuracy within
+/-1 sub-type. The five most useful features for the prediction are r-z, r-i,
r-J, r-H, and g-z, and hence lacking data in all SDSS bands substantially
reduces the prediction accuracy. However, we can achieve an accuracy of over
70% when the r and i magnitudes are available. Since the stars in this study
are nearby (d~1300 pc for 95% of the stars), the dust extinction can reduce the
prediction accuracy by only 3%. Finally, we used our optimized RF models to
predict the spectral sub-types of M dwarfs from the Catalog of Cool Dwarf
Targets for TESS, and we provide the optimized RF models for public use.",2023-04-27T11:51:45Z
"High-precision interpolation of stellar atmospheres with a deep neural
  network using a 1D convolutional auto encoder for feature extraction","Given the widespread availability of grids of models for stellar atmospheres,
it is necessary to recover intermediate atmospheric models by means of accurate
techniques that go beyond simple linear interpolation and capture the
intricacies of the data. Our goal is to establish a reliable, precise,
lightweight, and fast method for recovering stellar model atmospheres, that is
to say the stratification of mass column, temperature, gas pressure, and
electronic density with optical depth given any combination of the defining
atmospheric specific parameters: metallicity, effective temperature, and
surface gravity, as well as the abundances of other key chemical elements. We
employed a fully connected deep neural network which in turn uses a 1D
convolutional auto-encoder to extract the nonlinearities of a grid using the
ATLAS9 and MARCS model atmospheres. This new method we call iNNterpol
effectively takes into account the nonlinearities in the relationships of the
data as opposed to traditional machine-learning methods, such as the light
gradient boosting method (LightGBM), that are repeatedly used for their speed
in well-known competitions with reduced datasets. We show a higher precision
with a convolutional auto-encoder than using principal component analysis as a
feature extractor.We believe it constitutes a useful tool for generating fast
and precise stellar model atmospheres, mitigating convergence issues, as well
as a framework for future developments. The code and data for both training and
direct interpolation are available online at
https://github.com/cwestend/iNNterpol for full reproducibility and to serve as
a practical starting point for other continuous 1D data in the field and
elsewhere.",2023-06-12T08:16:26Z
"Probabilistic Classification of Infrared-selected targets for SPHEREx
  mission: In search of YSOs","We apply machine learning algorithms to classify Infrared (IR)-selected
targets for NASA's upcoming SPHEREx mission. In particular, we are interested
in classifying Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), which are essential for
understanding the star formation process. Our approach differs from previous
work, which has relied heavily on broadband color criteria to classify
IR-bright objects, and are typically implemented in color-color and
color-magnitude diagrams. However, these methods do not state the confidence
associated with the classification and the results from these methods are quite
ambiguous due to the overlap of different source types in these diagrams. Here,
we utilize photometric colors and magnitudes from seven near and mid-infrared
bands simultaneously and employ machine and deep learning algorithms to carry
out probabilistic classification of YSOs, Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars,
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and main-sequence (MS) stars. Our approach also
sub-classifies YSOs into Class I, II, III and flat spectrum YSOs, and AGB stars
into carbon-rich and oxygen-rich AGB stars. We apply our methods to
infrared-selected targets compiled in preparation for SPHEREx which are likely
to include YSOs and other classes of objects. Our classification indicates that
out of $8,308,384$ sources, $1,966,340$ have class prediction with probability
exceeding $90\%$, amongst which $\sim 1.7\%$ are YSOs, $\sim 58.2\%$ are AGB
stars, $\sim 40\%$ are (reddened) MS stars, and $\sim 0.1\%$ are AGN whose red
broadband colors mimic YSOs. We validate our classification using the spatial
distributions of predicted YSOs towards the Cygnus-X star-forming complex, as
well as AGB stars across the Galactic plane.",2023-09-22T15:56:58Z
"Quality flags for GSP-Phot Gaia DR3 astrophysical parameters with
  machine learning: Effective temperatures case study","Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) provides extensive information on the astrophysical
properties of stars, such as effective temperature, surface gravity,
metallicity, and luminosity, for over 470 million objects. However, as Gaia's
stellar parameters in GSP-Phot module are derived through model-dependent
methods and indirect measurements, it can lead to additional systematic errors
in the derived parameters. In this study, we compare GSP-Phot effective
temperature estimates with two high-resolution and high signal-to-noise
spectroscopic catalogues: APOGEE DR17 and GALAH DR3, aiming to assess the
reliability of Gaia's temperatures. We introduce an approach to distinguish
good-quality Gaia DR3 effective temperatures using machine-learning methods
such as XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM. The models create quality flags, which
can help one to distinguish good-quality GSP-Phot effective temperatures. We
test our models on three independent datasets, including PASTEL, a compilation
of spectroscopically derived stellar parameters from different high-resolution
studies. The results of the test suggest that with these models it is possible
to filter effective temperatures as accurate as 250 K with ~ 90 per cent
precision even in complex regions, such as the Galactic plane. Consequently,
the models developed herein offer a valuable quality assessment tool for
GSP-Phot effective temperatures in Gaia DR3. Consequently, the developed models
offer a valuable quality assessment tool for GSP-Phot effective temperatures in
Gaia DR3. The dataset with flags for all GSP-Phot effective temperature
estimates, is publicly available, as are the models themselves.",2023-10-24T09:30:59Z
"NEural Engine for Discovering Luminous Events (NEEDLE): identifying rare
  transient candidates in real time from host galaxy images","Known for their efficiency in analyzing large data sets, machine learning
classifiers are widely used in wide-field sky surveys. The upcoming Vera C.
Rubin Observatory Legacy of Time and Space Survey (LSST) will generate millions
of alerts every night, enabling the discovery of large samples of rare events.
Identifying such objects soon after explosion will be essential to study their
evolution. This requires a machine learning framework that makes use of all
available transient and contextual information. Using $\sim5400$ transients
from the ZTF Bright Transient Survey as input data, we develop NEEDLE, a novel
hybrid classifier to select for two rare classes with strong environmental
preferences: superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) preferring dwarf galaxies, and
tidal disruption events (TDEs) occurring in the centres of nucleated galaxies.
The input data includes detection and reference images, photometric information
from the alert packets, and host galaxy magnitudes from Pan-STARRS. Despite
having only a few tens of examples of the rare classes, our average (best)
completeness on an unseen test set reaches 77% (93%) for SLSNe and 72% (87%)
for TDEs. This may still result in a large fraction of false positives for the
rare transients, given the large class imbalance in real surveys. However, the
goal of NEEDLE is to find good candidates for spectroscopic classification,
rather than to select pure photometric samples. Our network is designed with
LSST in mind and we expect performance to improve further with the higher
resolution images and more accurate transient and host photometry that will be
available from Rubin. Our system will be deployed as an annotator on the UK
alert broker, Lasair, to provide predictions to the community in real time.",2023-12-08T10:59:49Z
"Forecasting Geoffective Events from Solar Wind Data and Evaluating the
  Most Predictive Features through Machine Learning Approaches","This study addresses the prediction of geomagnetic disturbances by exploiting
machine learning techniques. Specifically, the Long-Short Term Memory recurrent
neural network, which is particularly suited for application over long time
series, is employed in the analysis of in-situ measurements of solar wind
plasma and magnetic field acquired over more than one solar cycle, from $2005$
to $2019$, at the Lagrangian point L$1$. The problem is approached as a binary
classification aiming to predict one hour in advance a decrease in the SYM-H
geomagnetic activity index below the threshold of $-50$ nT, which is generally
regarded as indicative of magnetospheric perturbations. The strong class
imbalance issue is tackled by using an appropriate loss function tailored to
optimize appropriate skill scores in the training phase of the neural network.
Beside classical skill scores, value-weighted skill scores are then employed to
evaluate predictions, suitable in the study of problems, such as the one faced
here, characterized by strong temporal variability. For the first time, the
content of magnetic helicity and energy carried by solar transients, associated
with their detection and likelihood of geo-effectiveness, were considered as
input features of the network architecture. Their predictive capabilities are
demonstrated through a correlation-driven feature selection method to rank the
most relevant characteristics involved in the neural network prediction model.
The optimal performance of the adopted neural network in properly forecasting
the onset of geomagnetic storms, which is a crucial point for giving real
warnings in an operational setting, is finally showed.",2024-03-14T20:13:26Z
"Prediction of Space Weather Events through Analysis of Active Region
  Magnetograms using Convolutional Neural Network","Although space weather events may not directly affect human life, they have
the potential to inflict significant harm upon our communities. Harmful space
weather events can trigger atmospheric changes that result in physical and
economic damages on a global scale. In 1989, Earth experienced the effects of a
powerful geomagnetic storm that caused satellites to malfunction, while
triggering power blackouts in Canada, along with electricity disturbances in
the United States and Europe. With the solar cycle peak rapidly approaching,
there is an ever-increasing need to prepare and prevent the damages that can
occur, especially to modern-day technology, calling for the need of a
comprehensive prediction system. This study aims to leverage machine learning
techniques to predict instances of space weather (solar flares, coronal mass
ejections, geomagnetic storms), based on active region magnetograms of the Sun.
This was done through the use of the NASA DONKI service to determine when these
solar events occur, then using data from the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory to
compile a dataset that includes magnetograms of active regions of the Sun 24
hours before the events. By inputting the magnetograms into a convolutional
neural network (CNN) trained from this dataset, it can serve to predict whether
a space weather event will occur, and what type of event it will be. The model
was designed using a custom architecture CNN, and returned an accuracy of
90.27%, a precision of 85.83%, a recall of 91.78%, and an average F1 score of
92.14% across each class (Solar flare [Flare], geomagnetic storm [GMS], coronal
mass ejection [CME]). Our results show that using magnetogram data as an input
for a CNN is a viable method to space weather prediction. Future work can
involve prediction of the magnitude of solar events.",2024-05-04T03:04:51Z
"Real-Time Detection of Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Stars
  using Artificial Neural Networks","The groundbreaking discoveries of gravitational waves from binary black-hole
mergers and, most recently, coalescing neutron stars started a new era of
Multi-Messenger Astrophysics and revolutionized our understanding of the
Cosmos. Machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks are
already transforming many technological fields and have also proven successful
in gravitational-wave astrophysics for detection and characterization of
gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes. Here we use a deep-learning
approach to rapidly identify transient gravitational-wave signals from binary
neutron star mergers in noisy time series representative of typical
gravitational-wave detector data. Specifically, we show that a deep convolution
neural network trained on 100,000 data samples can rapidly identify binary
neutron star gravitational-wave signals and distinguish them from noise and
signals from merging black hole binaries. These results demonstrate the
potential of artificial neural networks for real-time detection of
gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron star mergers, which is critical
for a prompt follow-up and detailed observation of the electromagnetic and
astro-particle counterparts accompanying these important transients.",2019-08-08T16:21:27Z
"Detecting outliers and learning complex structures with large
  spectroscopic surveys - a case study with APOGEE stars","In this work we apply and expand on a recently introduced outlier detection
algorithm that is based on an unsupervised random forest. We use the algorithm
to calculate a similarity measure for stellar spectra from the Apache Point
Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We show that the similarity
measure traces non-trivial physical properties and contains information about
complex structures in the data. We use it for visualization and clustering of
the dataset, and discuss its ability to find groups of highly similar objects,
including spectroscopic twins. Using the similarity matrix to search the
dataset for objects allows us to find objects that are impossible to find using
their best fitting model parameters. This includes extreme objects for which
the models fail, and rare objects that are outside the scope of the model. We
use the similarity measure to detect outliers in the dataset, and find a number
of previously unknown Be-type stars, spectroscopic binaries, carbon rich stars,
young stars, and a few that we cannot interpret. Our work further demonstrates
the potential for scientific discovery when combining machine learning methods
with modern survey data.",2017-10-31T18:00:45Z
Auto-Calibration of Remote Sensing Solar Telescopes with Deep Learning,"As a part of NASA's Heliophysics System Observatory (HSO) fleet of
satellites,the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) has continuously monitored the
Sun since2010. Ultraviolet (UV) and Extreme UV (EUV) instruments in orbit, such
asSDO's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument, suffer time-dependent
degradation which reduces instrument sensitivity. Accurate calibration for
(E)UV instruments currently depends on periodic sounding rockets, which are
infrequent and not practical for heliophysics missions in deep space. In the
present work, we develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that
auto-calibrates SDO/AIA channels and corrects sensitivity degradation by
exploiting spatial patterns in multi-wavelength observations to arrive at a
self-calibration of (E)UV imaging instruments. Our results remove a major
impediment to developing future HSOmissions of the same scientific caliber as
SDO but in deep space, able to observe the Sun from more vantage points than
just SDO's current geosynchronous orbit.This approach can be adopted to perform

A Robust Hot Subdwarfs Identification Method Based on Deep Learning,"Hot subdwarf star is a particular type of star that is crucial for studying
binary evolution and atmospheric diffusion processes. In recent years,
identifying Hot subdwarfs by machine learning methods has become a hot topic,
but there are still limitations in automation and accuracy. In this paper, we
proposed a robust identification method based on the convolutional neural
network (CNN). We first constructed the dataset using the spectral data of
LAMOS DR7-V1. We then constructed a hybrid recognition model including an
8-class classification model and a binary classification model. The model
achieved an accuracy of 96.17% on the testing set. To further validate the
accuracy of the model, we selected 835 Hot subdwarfs that were not involved in
the training process from the identified LAMOST catalog (2428, including
repeated observations) as the validation set. An accuracy of 96.05% was
achieved. On this basis, we used the model to filter and classify all
10,640,255 spectra of LAMOST DR7-V1, and obtained a catalog of 2393 Hot
subdwarf candidates, of which 2067 have been confirmed. We found 25 new Hot
subdwarfs among the remaining candidates by manual validation. The overall
accuracy of the model is 87.42%. Overall, the model presented in this study can
effectively identify specific spectra with robust results and high accuracy,
and can be further applied to the classification of large-scale spectra and the
search of specific targets.",2022-01-22T05:38:26Z
"Semi-Supervised Classification and Clustering Analysis for Variable
  Stars","The immense amount of time series data produced by astronomical surveys has
called for the use of machine learning algorithms to discover and classify
several million celestial sources. In the case of variable stars, supervised
learning approaches have become commonplace. However, this needs a considerable
collection of expert-labeled light curves to achieve adequate performance,
which is costly to construct. To solve this problem, we introduce two
approaches. First, a semi-supervised hierarchical method, which requires
substantially less trained data than supervised methods. Second, a clustering
analysis procedure that finds groups that may correspond to classes or
sub-classes of variable stars. Both methods are primarily supported by
dimensionality reduction of the data for visualization and to avoid the curse
of dimensionality. We tested our methods with catalogs collected from OGLE,
CSS, and Gaia surveys. The semi-supervised method reaches a performance of
around 90\% for all of our three selected catalogs of variable stars using only
$5\%$ of the data in the training. This method is suitable for classifying the
main classes of variable stars when there is only a small amount of training
data. Our clustering analysis confirms that most of the clusters found have a
purity over 90\% with respect to classes and 80\% with respect to sub-classes,
suggesting that this type of analysis can be used in large-scale variability
surveys as an initial step to identify which classes or sub-classes of variable
stars are present in the data and/or to build training sets, among many other
possible applications.",2022-09-20T19:26:06Z
"Predictive Modeling of Coronal Hole Areas Using Long Short-Term Memory
  Networks","In the era of space exploration, the implications of space weather have
become increasingly evident. Central to this is the phenomenon of coronal
holes, which can significantly influence the functioning of satellites and
aircraft. These coronal holes, present on the sun, are distinguished by their
open magnetic field lines and comparatively cooler temperatures, leading to the
emission of solar winds at heightened rates. To anticipate the effects of these
coronal holes on Earth, our study harnesses computer vision to pinpoint the
coronal hole regions and estimate their dimensions using imagery from the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Further, we deploy deep learning methodologies,
specifically the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach, to analyze the trends
in the data related to the area of the coronal holes and predict their
dimensions across various solar regions over a span of seven days. By
evaluating the time series data concerning the area of the coronal holes, our
research seeks to uncover patterns in the behavior of coronal holes and
comprehend their potential influence on space weather occurrences. This
investigation marks a pivotal stride towards bolstering our capacity to
anticipate and brace for space weather events that could have ramifications for
Earth and its technological apparatuses.",2023-01-17T07:22:54Z
Uncovering Heterogeneity of Solar Flare Mechanism With Mixture Models,"The physics of solar flares occurring on the Sun is highly complex and far
from fully understood. However, observations show that solar eruptions are
associated with the intense kilogauss fields of active regions, where free
energies are stored with field-aligned electric currents. With the advent of
high-quality data sources such as the Geostationary Operational Environmental
Satellites (GOES) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI), recent works on solar flare forecasting have been
focusing on data-driven methods. In particular, black box machine learning and
deep learning models are increasingly adopted in which underlying data
structures are not modeled explicitly. If the active regions indeed follow the
same laws of physics, there should be similar patterns shared among them,
reflected by the observations. Yet, these black box models currently used in
the literature do not explicitly characterize the heterogeneous nature of the
solar flare data, within and between active regions. In this paper, we propose
two finite mixture models designed to capture the heterogeneous patterns of
active regions and their associated solar flare events. With extensive
numerical studies, we demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed method for
both resolving the sample imbalance issue and modeling the heterogeneity for
rare energetic solar flare events.",2024-01-25T17:44:48Z
"M-dwarf flares in the Zwicky Transient Facility data and what we can
  learn from them","In this paper, we explore the possibility of detecting M-dwarf flares using
data from the Zwicky Transient Facility data releases (ZTF DRs). We employ two
different approaches: the traditional method of parametric fit search and a
machine learning algorithm originally developed for anomaly detection. We
analyzed over 35 million ZTF light curves and visually scrutinized 1168
candidates suggested by the algorithms to filter out artifacts, occultations of
a star by an asteroid, and known variable objects of other types. Our final
sample comprises 134 flares with amplitude ranging from 0.2 to 4.6 magnitudes,
including repeated flares and complex flares with multiple components. Using
Pan-STARRS DR2 colors, we also assigned a corresponding spectral subclass to
each object in the sample. For 13 flares with well-sampled light curves, we
estimated the bolometric energy. Our results show that the ZTF's cadence
strategy is suitable for identifying M-dwarf flares and other fast transients,
allowing for the extraction of significant astrophysical information from their
light curves.",2024-04-11T14:54:29Z
Flow-Based Generative Emulation of Grids of Stellar Evolutionary Models,"We present a flow-based generative approach to emulate grids of stellar
evolutionary models. By interpreting the input parameters and output properties
of these models as multi-dimensional probability distributions, we train
conditional normalizing flows to learn and predict the complex relationships
between grid inputs and outputs in the form of conditional joint distributions.
Leveraging the expressive power and versatility of these flows, we showcase
their ability to emulate a variety of evolutionary tracks and isochrones across
a continuous range of input parameters. In addition, we describe a simple
Bayesian approach for estimating stellar parameters using these flows and
demonstrate its application to asteroseismic datasets of red giants observed by
the Kepler mission. By applying this approach to red giants in open clusters
NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, we illustrate how large age uncertainties can arise when
fitting only to global asteroseismic and spectroscopic parameters without prior
information on initial helium abundances and mixing length parameter values. We
also conduct inference using the flow at a large scale by determining revised
estimates of masses and radii for 15,388 field red giants. These estimates show
improved agreement with results from existing grid-based modelling, reveal
distinct population-level features in the red clump, and suggest that the
masses of Kepler red giants previously determined using the corrected
asteroseismic scaling relations have been overestimated by 5-10%.",2024-07-12T16:54:17Z
"Deep learning interpretable analysis for carbon star identification in
  Gaia DR3","Context. A large fraction of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars develop
carbon-rich atmospheres during their evolution. Based on their color and
luminosity, these carbon stars can be easily distinguished from many other
kinds of stars. However, a large number of G, K, and M giants are also
distributed in the same region as carbon stars on the HR diagram. Their spectra
have differences,especially in the prominent CN molecular bands. Aims. We aim
to distinguish carbon stars from other kinds of stars using Gaia's XP spectra,
while providing attribution explanations of key features necessary for
identification, and even discovering additional new spectral key features.
Methods. We proposed a classification model named `GaiaNet', an improved
one-dimensional convolutional neural network specifically designed for handling
Gaia's XP spectra. We utilized the SHAP interpretability model to calculate the
SHAP value for each feature point in a spectrum, enabling us to explain the
output of the `GaiaNet' model and provide further meaningful analysis Results.
Compared to four traditional machine-learning methods, the `GaiaNet' model
exhibits an average classification accuracy improvement of approximately 0.3%
on the validation set, with the highest accuracy even reaching 100%. Utilizing
the SHAP algorithm, we present a clear spectroscopic heatmap highlighting
molecular band absorption features primarily distributed mainly around CN773.3
and CN895.0, and summarize five crucial feature regions for carbon star
identification. Upon applying the trained classification model to the CSTAR
sample with Gaia `xp_sampled_mean' spectra, we obtained 451 new candidate
carbon stars as a by-product.",2024-07-26T14:09:04Z
"A recurrent neural network for classification of unevenly sampled
  variable stars","Astronomical surveys of celestial sources produce streams of noisy time
series measuring flux versus time (""light curves""). Unlike in many other
physical domains, however, large (and source-specific) temporal gaps in data
arise naturally due to intranight cadence choices as well as diurnal and
seasonal constraints. With nightly observations of millions of variable stars
and transients from upcoming surveys, efficient and accurate discovery and
classification techniques on noisy, irregularly sampled data must be employed
with minimal human-in-the-loop involvement. Machine learning for inference
tasks on such data traditionally requires the laborious hand-coding of
domain-specific numerical summaries of raw data (""features""). Here we present a
novel unsupervised autoencoding recurrent neural network (RNN) that makes
explicit use of sampling times and known heteroskedastic noise properties. When
trained on optical variable star catalogs, this network produces supervised
classification models that rival other best-in-class approaches. We find that
autoencoded features learned on one time-domain survey perform nearly as well
when applied to another survey. These networks can continue to learn from new
unlabeled observations and may be used in other unsupervised tasks such as
forecasting and anomaly detection.",2017-11-28T23:17:53Z
"Advancing Solar Flare Prediction using Deep Learning with Active Region
  Patches","In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for leveraging shape-based
characteristics of magnetograms of active region (AR) patches and provide a
novel capability for predicting solar flares covering the entirety of the solar
disk (AR patches spanning from -90$^{\circ}$ to +90$^{\circ}$ of solar
longitude). We create three deep learning models: (i) ResNet34, (ii) MobileNet,
and (iii) MobileViT to predict $\geq$M-class flares and assess the efficacy of
these models across various ranges of solar longitude. Given the inherent
imbalance in our data, we employ augmentation techniques alongside
undersampling during the model training phase, while maintaining imbalanced
partitions in the testing data for realistic evaluation. We use a composite
skill score (CSS) as our evaluation metric, computed as the geometric mean of
the True Skill Score (TSS) and the Heidke Skill Score (HSS) to rank and compare
models. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: (i) We introduce
a novel capability in solar flare prediction that allows predicting flares for
each ARs throughout the solar disk and evaluate and compare the performance,
(ii) Our candidate model (MobileNet) achieves a CSS=0.51 (TSS=0.60 and
HSS=0.44), CSS=0.51 (TSS=0.59 and HSS=0.44), and CSS=0.48 (TSS=0.56 and
HSS=0.40) for AR patches within $\pm$30$^{\circ}$, $\pm$60$^{\circ}$,
$\pm$90$^{\circ}$ of solar longitude respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate
the ability to issue flare forecasts for ARs in near-limb regions (regions
between $\pm$60$^{\circ}$ to $\pm$90 $^{\circ}$) with a CSS=0.39 (TSS=0.48 and
HSS=0.32), expanding the scope of AR-based models for solar flare prediction.
This advancement opens new avenues for more reliable prediction of solar
flares, thereby contributing to improved forecasting capabilities.",2024-06-16T19:35:41Z
"There Are (super)Giants in the Sky: Searching for Misidentified Massive
  Stars in Algorithmically-Selected Quasar Catalogs","Thanks to incredible advances in instrumentation, surveys like the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey have been able to find and catalog billions of objects,
ranging from local M dwarfs to distant quasars. Machine learning algorithms
have greatly aided in the effort to classify these objects; however, there are
regimes where these algorithms fail, where interesting oddities may be found.
We present here an X-ray bright quasar misidentified as a red supergiant/X-ray
binary, and a subsequent search of the SDSS quasar catalog for X-ray bright
stars misidentified as quasars.",2017-01-26T22:00:06Z
"Robust, open-source removal of systematics in Kepler data","We present ARC2 (Astrophysically Robust Correction 2), an open-source
Python-based systematics-correction pipeline to correct for the Kepler prime
mission long cadence light curves. The ARC2 pipeline identifies and corrects
any isolated discontinuities in the light curves, then removes trends common to
many light curves. These trends are modelled using the publicly available
co-trending basis vectors, within an (approximate) Bayesian framework with
`shrinkage' priors to minimise the risk of over-fitting and the injection of
any additional noise into the corrected light curves, while keeping any
astrophysical signals intact. We show that the ARC2 pipeline's performance
matches that of the standard Kepler PDC-MAP data products using standard noise
metrics, and demonstrate its ability to preserve astrophysical signals using
injection tests with simulated stellar rotation and planetary transit signals.
Although it is not identical, the ARC2 pipeline can thus be used as an open
source alternative to PDC-MAP, whenever the ability to model the impact of the
systematics removal process on other kinds of signal is important.",2017-06-09T16:10:44Z
"Total-variation methods for gravitational-wave denoising: performance
  tests on Advanced LIGO data","We assess total-variation methods to denoise gravitational-wave signals in
real noise conditions, by injecting numerical-relativity waveforms from
core-collapse supernovae and binary black hole mergers in data from the first
observing run of Advanced LIGO. This work is an extension of our previous
investigation where only Gaussian noise was used. Since the quality of the
results depends on the regularization parameter of the model, we perform an
heuristic search for the value that produces the best results. We discuss
various approaches for the selection of this parameter, either based on the
optimal, mean, or multiple values, and compare the results of the denoising
upon these choices. Moreover, we also present a machine-learning-informed
approach to obtain the Lagrange multiplier of the method through an automatic
search. Our results provide further evidence that total-variation methods can
be useful in the field of Gravitational-Wave Astronomy as a tool to remove
noise.",2018-06-19T16:20:13Z
"Characterizing magnetic reconnection regions using Gaussian mixture
  models on particle velocity distributions","We present a method based on unsupervised machine learning to identify
regions of interest using particle velocity distributions as a signature
pattern. An automatic density estimation technique is applied to particle
distributions provided by PIC simulations to study magnetic reconnection. The
key components of the method involve: i) a Gaussian mixture model determining
the presence of a given number of subpopulations within an overall population,
and ii) a model selection technique with Bayesian Information Criterion to
estimate the appropriate number of subpopulations. Thus, this method identifies
automatically the presence of complex distributions, such as beams or other
non-Maxwellian features, and can be used as a detection algorithm able to
identify reconnection regions. The approach is demonstrated for specific double
Harris sheet simulations but it can in principle be applied to any other type
of simulation and observational data on the particle distribution function.",2019-10-22T14:45:01Z
"A Random Forest Approach to Identifying Young Stellar Object Candidates
  in the Lupus Star-Forming Region","The identification and characterization of stellar members within a
star-forming region are critical to many aspects of star formation, including
formalization of the initial mass function, circumstellar disk evolution and
star-formation history. Previous surveys of the Lupus star-forming region have
identified members through infrared excess and accretion signatures. We use
machine learning to identify new candidate members of Lupus based on surveys
from two space-based observatories: ESA's Gaia and NASA's Spitzer. Astrometric
measurements from Gaia's Data Release 2 and astrometric and photometric data
from the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope, as well
as from other surveys, are compiled into a catalog for the Random Forest (RF)
classifier. The RF classifiers are tested to find the best features, membership
list, non-membership identification scheme, imputation method, training set
class weighting and method of dealing with class imbalance within the data. We
list 27 candidate members of the Lupus star-forming region for spectroscopic
follow-up. Most of the candidates lie in Clouds V and VI, where only one
confirmed member of Lupus was previously known. These clouds likely represent a
slightly older population of star-formation.",2020-03-23T23:10:20Z
Identifying microlensing events using neural networks,"Current gravitational microlensing surveys are observing hundreds of millions
of stars in the Galactic bulge - which makes finding rare microlensing events a
challenging tasks. In almost all previous works, microlensing events have been
detected either by applying very strict selection cuts or manually inspecting
tens of thousands of light curves. However, the number of microlensing events
expected in the future space-based microlensing experiments forces us to
consider fully-automated approaches. They are especially important for
selecting binary-lens events that often exhibit complex light curve
morphologies and are otherwise difficult to find. There are no dedicated
selection algorithms for binary-lens events in the literature, which hampers
their statistical studies. Here, we present two simple neural-network-based
classifiers for detecting single and binary microlensing events. We demonstrate
their robustness using OGLE-III and OGLE-IV data sets and show they perform
well on microlensing events detected in data from the Zwicky Transient Facility
(ZTF). Classifiers are able to correctly recognize ~98% of single-lens events
and 80-85% of binary-lens events.",2020-08-27T06:18:44Z
STag: Supernova Tagging and Classification,"Supernovae classes have been defined phenomenologically, based on spectral
features and time series data, since the specific details of the physics of the
different explosions remain unrevealed. However, the number of these classes is
increasing as objects with new features are observed, and the next generation
of large-surveys will only bring more variety to our attention. We apply the
machine learning technique of multi-label classification to the spectra of
supernovae. By measuring the probabilities of specific features or `tags' in
the supernova spectra, we can compress the information from a specific object
down to that suitable for a human or database scan, without the need to
directly assign to a reductive `class'. We use logistic regression to assign
tag probabilities, and then a feed-forward neural network to filter the objects
into the standard set of classes, based solely on the tag probabilities. We
present STag, a software package that can compute these tag probabilities and
make spectral classifications.",2021-08-24T03:00:39Z
"Modelling stars with Gaussian Process Regression: Augmenting Stellar
  Model Grid","Grid-based modelling is widely used for estimating stellar parameters.
However, stellar model grid is sparse because of the computational cost. This
paper demonstrates an application of a machine-learning algorithm using the
Gaussian Process (GP) Regression that turns a sparse model grid onto a
continuous function. We train GP models to map five fundamental inputs (mass,
equivalent evolutionary phase, initial metallicity, initial helium fraction,
and the mixing-length parameter) to observable outputs (effective temperature,
surface gravity, radius, surface metallicity, and stellar age). We test the GP
predictions for the five outputs using off-grid stellar models and find no
obvious systematic offsets, indicating good accuracy in predictions.As a
further validation, we apply these GP models to characterise 1,000 fake stars.
Inferred masses and ages determined with GP models well recover true values
within one standard deviation. An important consequence of using GP-based
interpolation is that stellar ages are more precise than those estimated with
the original sparse grid because of the full sampling of fundamental inputs.",2022-02-17T01:33:00Z
Simulating high-time resolution radio-telescope observations,"We describe a new software package for simulating channelised, high-time
resolution data streams from radio telescopes. The software simulates data from
the telescope and observing system taking into account the observation
strategy, receiver system and digitisation. The signatures of pulsars, fast
radio bursts and flare stars are modelled, including frequency-dependent
effects such as scattering and scintillation. We also simulate more generic
signals using spline curves and images. Models of radio frequency interference
include signals from satellites, terrestrial transmitters and impulsive,
broadband signals. The simulated signals can also be injected into real data
sets. Uses of this software include the production of machine learning training
data sets, development and testing of new algorithms to search for anomalous
patterns and to characterise processing pipelines.",2022-05-06T07:07:19Z
Modelling stellar activity with Gaussian process regression networks,"Stellar photospheric activity is known to limit the detection and
characterisation of extra-solar planets. In particular, the study of Earth-like
planets around Sun-like stars requires data analysis methods that can
accurately model the stellar activity phenomena affecting radial velocity (RV)
measurements. Gaussian Process Regression Networks (GPRNs) offer a principled
approach to the analysis of simultaneous time-series, combining the structural
properties of Bayesian neural networks with the non-parametric flexibility of
Gaussian Processes. Using HARPS-N solar spectroscopic observations encompassing
three years, we demonstrate that this framework is capable of jointly modelling
RV data and traditional stellar activity indicators. Although we consider only
the simplest GPRN configuration, we are able to describe the behaviour of solar
RV data at least as accurately as previously published methods. We confirm the
correlation between the RV and stellar activity time series reaches a maximum
at separations of a few days, and find evidence of non-stationary behaviour in
the time series, associated with an approaching solar activity minimum.",2022-05-13T13:20:25Z
"Predicting the Stability of Hierarchical Triple Systems with
  Convolutional Neural Networks","Understanding the long-term evolution of hierarchical triple systems is
challenging due to its inherent chaotic nature, and it requires computationally
expensive simulations. Here we propose a convolutional neural network model to
predict the stability of hierarchical triples by looking at their evolution
during the first $5 \times 10^5$ inner binary orbits. We employ the regularized
few-body code TSUNAMI to simulate $5\times 10^6$ hierarchical triples, from
which we generate a large training and test dataset. We develop twelve
different network configurations that use different combinations of the
triples' orbital elements and compare their performances. Our best model uses 6
time-series, namely, the semimajor axes ratio, the inner and outer
eccentricities, the mutual inclination and the arguments of pericenter. This
model achieves an area under the curve of over $95\%$ and informs of the
relevant parameters to study triple systems stability. All trained models are
made publicly available, allowing to predict the stability of hierarchical
triple systems $200$ times faster than pure $N$-body methods.",2022-06-24T17:58:13Z
Chaos in multiplanetary extrasolar systems,"Here we present an initial look at the dynamics and stability of 178
multiplanetary systems which are already confirmed and listed in the NASA
Exoplanet Archive. To distinguish between the chaotic and regular nature of a
system, the value of the MEGNO indicator for each system was determined. Almost
three-quarters of them could be labelled as long-term stable. Only 45 studied
systems show chaotic behaviour. We consequently investigated the effects of the
number of planets and their parameters on the system stability. A comparison of
results obtained using the MEGNO indicator and machine-learning algorithm SPOCK
suggests that the SPOCK could be used as an effective tool for reviewing the
stability of multiplanetary systems. A similar study was already published by
Laskar and Petit in 2017. We compared their analysis based on the AMD criterion
with our results. The possible discrepancies are discussed.",2022-11-03T11:23:11Z

impressive progress for the last years, major problems and puzzles remain. In
the present contribution, only a few nuclear astrophysics specific aspects are
discussed. These concern some experimental progress related to the measurement
of key reactions of relevance for the so-called s-and p-processes of

"Identifying hot subdwarf stars from photometric data using Gaussian
  mixture model and graph neural network","Hot subdwarf stars are very important for understanding stellar evolution,
stellar astrophysics, and binary star systems. Identifying more such stars can
help us better understand their statistical distribution, properties, and
evolution. In this paper, we present a new method to search for hot subdwarf
stars in photometric data (b, y, g, r, i, z) using a machine learning
algorithm, graph neural network, and Gaussian mixture model. We use a Gaussian
mixture model and Markov distance to build the graph structure, and on the
graph structure, we use a graph neural network to identify hot subdwarf stars
from 86 084 stars, when the recall, precision, and f1 score are maximized on
the original, weight and synthetic minority oversampling technique datasets.
Finally, from 21 885 candidates, we selected approximately 6 000 stars that
were the most similar to the hot subdwarf star.",2022-12-20T08:25:15Z
A New Scenario of Solar Modulation Model during the Polarity Reversing,"When the Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) entering the heliosphere, they encounter
the solar wind plasma, and their intensity is reduced, so-called solar
modulation. The modulation is caused by the combination of a few factors, such
as particle energies, solar activity and solar disturbance. In this work, a 2D
numerical method is adopted to simulate the propagation of GCRs in the
heliosphere with SOLARPROP, and to overcome the time-consuming issue, the
machine learning technique is also applied. With the obtained proton local
interstellar spectra (LIS) based on the observation from Voyager 1 and AMS-02,
the solar modulation parameters during the solar maximum activity of cycle 24
have been found. It shows the normalization and index of the diffusion
coefficient indeed reach a maximal value in February 2014. However, after
taking into account the travel time of particles with different energies, the
peak time was found postponed to November 2014 as expected. The nine-month late
is so-called time lag.",2023-03-08T09:18:34Z
"Tip of the Red Giant Branch Bounds on the Axion-Electron Coupling
  Revisited","We present a novel method to constrain the axion-electron coupling constant
using the observed calibration of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) I band
magnitude $M_I$ that fully accounts for uncertainties and degeneracies with
stellar input physics.~We simulate a grid of 116,250 models varying initial
mass, helium abundance, and metallicity and train a machine learning emulator
to predict $M_I$ as a function of these parameters.~Our emulator enables the
use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations where the axion-electron coupling
$\alpha_{26}$ is varied simultaneously with the stellar parameters. We find
that, once stellar uncertainties and degeneracies are accounted for, the region
$\alpha_{26} < 2$ is not excluded by empirical TRGB calibrations.~Our work
opens up a large region of parameter space currently believed to be
excluded.~$\alpha_{26} = 2$ is the upper limit of the parameter space
considered by this study, and it is likely that larger values of $\alpha_{26}$
are also unconstrained.~We discuss potential applications of our work to
reevaluate other astrophysical probes of new physics.",2023-05-04T19:16:10Z
"Ion-Driven Instabilities in the Inner Heliosphere II: Classification and
  Multi-Dimensional Mapping","Linear theory is a well developed framework for characterizing instabilities
in weakly collisional plasmas, such as the solar wind. In the previous
instalment of this series, we analyzed ~1.5M proton and alpha particle Velocity
Distribution Functions (VDFs) observed by Helios I and II to determine the
statistical properties of the standard instability parameters such as the
growth rate, frequency, the direction of wave propagation, and the power
emitted or absorbed by each component, as well as to characterize their
behavior with respect to the distance from the Sun and collisional processing.
In this work, we use this comprehensive set of instability calculations to
train a Machine Learning algorithm consisting of three interlaced components
that: 1) predict if an interval is unstable from observed VDF parameters; 2)
predict the instability properties for a given unstable VDF; and 3) classify
the type of the unstable mode. We use these methods to map the properties in
multi-dimensional phase space to find that the parallel-propagating,
proton-core-induced Ion Cyclotron mode dominates the young solar wind, while
the oblique Fast Magnetosonic mode regulates the proton beam drift in the
collisionally old plasma.",2023-06-09T17:35:39Z
"Toward a Spectral Foundation Model: An Attention-Based Approach with
  Domain-Inspired Fine-Tuning and Wavelength Parameterization","Astrophysical explorations are underpinned by large-scale stellar
spectroscopy surveys, necessitating a paradigm shift in spectral fitting
techniques. Our study proposes three enhancements to transcend the limitations
of the current spectral emulation models. We implement an attention-based
emulator, adept at unveiling long-range information between wavelength pixels.
We leverage a domain-specific fine-tuning strategy where the model is
pre-trained on spectra with fixed stellar parameters and variable elemental
abundances, followed by fine-tuning on the entire domain. Moreover, by treating
wavelength as an autonomous model parameter, akin to neural radiance fields,
the model can generate spectra on any wavelength grid. In the case with a
training set of O(1000), our approach exceeds current leading methods by a
factor of 5-10 across all metrics.",2023-06-27T02:07:50Z

hybrid time series prediction model, specifically combination of Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and ARIMA, to analyze trends in the area of
coronal holes and predict their areas across various solar regions over a span

  Function for Eclipse Mapping of Cataclysmic Variables","With a particular focus on Scipy's minimize function the eclipse mapping
method is thoroughly researched and implemented utilizing Python and essential
libraries. Many optimization techniques are used, including Sequential Least
Squares Programming (SLSQP), Nelder-Mead, and Conjugate Gradient (CG). However,
for the purpose of examining photometric light curves these methods seek to
solve the maximum entropy equation under a chi-squared constraint. Therefore,
these techniques are first evaluated on two-dimensional Gaussian data without a
chi-squared restriction, and then they are used to map the accretion disc and
uncover the Gaussian structure of the Cataclysmic Variable KIC 201325107.
Critical analysis is performed on the code structure to find possible faults
and design problems. Additionally, the analysis shows how several factors
impacting computing time and image quality are included including the variance
in Gaussian weighting, disc image resolution, number of data points in the
light curve, and degree of constraint.",2024-05-30T18:57:52Z
"Calibrating global behaviour of equation of state by combining nuclear
  and astrophysics inputs in a machine learning approach","We implemented symbolic regression techniques to identify suitable analytical
functions that map various properties of neutron stars (NSs), obtained by
solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, to a few key parameters
of the equation of state (EoS). These symbolic regression models (SRMs) are
then employed to perform Bayesian inference with a comprehensive dataset from
nuclear physics experiments and astrophysical observations. The posterior
distributions of EoS parameters obtained from Bayesian inference using SRMs
closely match those obtained directly from the solutions of TOV equations. Our
SRM-based approach is approximately 100 times faster, enabling efficient
Bayesian analyses across different combinations of data to explore their
sensitivity to various EoS parameters within a reasonably short time.",2024-07-11T14:37:05Z
"J-PLUS: Discovery and characterisation of ultracool dwarfs using Virtual
  Observatory tools II. Second data release and machine learning methodology","Ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) comprise the lowest mass members of the stellar
population and brown dwarfs, from M7 V to cooler objects with L, T, and Y
spectral types. Most of them have been discovered using wide-field imaging
surveys, for which the Virtual Observatory (VO) has proven to be of great
utility. We aim to perform a search for UCDs in the entire Javalambre
Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) second data release (2176 deg$^2$)
following a VO methodology. We also explore the ability to reproduce this
search with a purely machine learning (ML)-based methodology that relies solely
on J-PLUS photometry. We followed three different approaches based on
parallaxes, proper motions, and colours, respectively, using the VOSA tool to
estimate the effective temperatures. For the ML methodology, we built a
two-step method based on principal component analysis and support vector
machine algorithms. We identified a total of 7827 new candidate UCDs, which
represents an increase of about 135% in the number of UCDs reported in the sky
coverage of the J-PLUS second data release. Among the candidate UCDs, we found
122 possible unresolved binary systems, 78 wide multiple systems, and 48
objects with a high Bayesian probability of belonging to a young association.
We also identified four objects with strong excess in the filter corresponding
to the Ca II H and K emission lines and four other objects with excess emission
in the H$\alpha$ filter. With the ML approach, we obtained a recall score of
92% and 91% in the test and blind test, respectively. We consolidated the
proposed search methodology for UCDs, which will be used in deeper and larger
upcoming surveys such as J-PAS and Euclid. We concluded that the ML methodology
is more efficient in the sense that it allows for a larger number of true
negatives to be discarded prior to analysis with VOSA, although it is more
photometrically restrictive.",2022-08-19T14:44:13Z
"The eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS). The stellar
  counterparts of eROSITA sources identified by machine learning and Bayesian
  algorithms","Stars are ubiquitous X-ray emitters and will be a substantial fraction of the
X-ray sources detected in the on-going all-sky survey performed by the eROSITA
instrument aboard the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) observatory. We use the
X-ray sources in the eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS) field
observed during the SRG performance verification phase to investigate different
strategies to identify the stars among other source categories. We focus here
on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Bayesian approaches, and our approaches are
based on a cross-match with the Gaia catalog, which will eventually contain
counterparts to virtually all stellar eROSITA sources. We estimate that 2060
stars are among the eFEDS sources based on the geometric match distance
distribution, and we identify the 2060 most likely stellar sources with the SVM
and Bayesian methods, the latter being named HamStars in the eROSITA context.
Both methods reach completeness and reliability percentages of almost 90%, and
the agreement between both methods is, incidentally, also about 90%. Knowing
the true number of stellar sources allowed us to derive association
probabilities $p_{ij}$ for the SVM method similar to the Bayesian method so
that one can construct samples with defined completeness and reliability
properties using appropriate cuts in $p_{ij}$. The thus identified stellar
sources show the typical characteristics known for magnetically active stars,
specifically, they are generally compatible with the saturation level, show a
large spread in activity for stars of spectral F to G, and have comparatively
high fractional X-ray luminosities for later spectral types.",2021-06-28T10:07:53Z
Toward Filament Segmentation Using Deep Neural Networks,"We use a well-known deep neural network framework, called Mask R-CNN, for
identification of solar filaments in full-disk H-alpha images from Big Bear
Solar Observatory (BBSO). The image data, collected from BBSO's archive, are
integrated with the spatiotemporal metadata of filaments retrieved from the
Heliophysics Events Knowledgebase (HEK) system. This integrated data is then
treated as the ground-truth in the training process of the model. The available
spatial metadata are the output of a currently running filament-detection
module developed and maintained by the Feature Finding Team; an international
consortium selected by NASA. Despite the known challenges in the identification
and characterization of filaments by the existing module, which in turn are
inherited into any other module that intends to learn from such outputs, Mask
R-CNN shows promising results. Trained and validated on two years worth of BBSO
data, this model is then tested on the three following years. Our case-by-case
and overall analyses show that Mask R-CNN can clearly compete with the existing
module and in some cases even perform better. Several cases of false positives
and false negatives, that are correctly segmented by this model are also shown.
The overall advantages of using the proposed model are two-fold: First, deep
neural networks' performance generally improves as more annotated data, or
better annotations are provided. Second, such a model can be scaled up to
detect other solar events, as well as a single multi-purpose module. The
results presented in this study introduce a proof of concept in benefits of
employing deep neural networks for detection of solar events, and in
particular, filaments.",2019-11-20T17:45:41Z
"Low Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network For Solar Flares GOES Time
  Series Classification","Space weather phenomena such as solar flares, have massive destructive power
when reaches certain amount of magnitude. Such high magnitude solar flare event
can interfere space-earth radio communications and neutralize space-earth
electronics equipment. In the current study, we explorer the deep learning
approach to build a solar flare forecasting model and examine its limitations
along with the ability of features extraction, based on the available
time-series data. For that purpose, we present a multi-layer 1D Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) to forecast solar flare events probability occurrence of M
and X classes at 1,3,6,12,24,48,72,96 hours time frame. In order to train and
evaluate the performance of the model, we utilised the available Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) X-ray time series data, ranged
between July 1998 and January 2019, covering almost entirely the solar cycles
23 and 24. The forecasting model were trained and evaluated in two different
scenarios (1) random selection and (2) chronological selection, which were
compare afterward. Moreover we compare our results to those considered as
state-of-the-art flare forecasting models, both with similar approaches and
different ones.The majority of the results indicates that (1) chronological
selection obtain a degradation factor of 3\% versus the random selection for
the M class model and elevation factor of 2\% for the X class model. (2) When
consider utilizing only X-ray time-series data, the suggested model achieve
high score results compare to other studies. (3) The suggested model combined
with solely X-ray time-series fails to distinguish between M class magnitude

Global geomagnetic perturbation forecasting using Deep Learning,"Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs) arise from spatio-temporal changes to
Earth's magnetic field which arise from the interaction of the solar wind with
Earth's magnetosphere, and drive catastrophic destruction to our
technologically dependent society. Hence, computational models to forecast GICs
globally with large forecast horizon, high spatial resolution and temporal
cadence are of increasing importance to perform prompt necessary mitigation.
Since GIC data is proprietary, the time variability of horizontal component of
the magnetic field perturbation (dB/dt) is used as a proxy for GICs. In this
work, we develop a fast, global dB/dt forecasting model, which forecasts 30
minutes into the future using only solar wind measurements as input. The model
summarizes 2 hours of solar wind measurement using a Gated Recurrent Unit, and
generates forecasts of coefficients which are folded with a spherical harmonic
basis to enable global forecasts. When deployed, our model produces results in
under a second, and generates global forecasts for horizontal magnetic
perturbation components at 1-minute cadence. We evaluate our model across
models in literature for two specific storms of 5 August 2011 and 17 March
2015, while having a self-consistent benchmark model set. Our model
outperforms, or has consistent performance with state-of-the-practice high time
cadence local and low time cadence global models, while also
outperforming/having comparable performance with the benchmark models. Such
quick inferences at high temporal cadence and arbitrary spatial resolutions may
ultimately enable accurate forewarning of dB/dt for any place on Earth,
resulting in precautionary measures to be taken in an informed manner.",2022-05-12T18:58:16Z
"A self-consistent data-driven model for determining stellar parameters
  from optical and near-IR spectra","Data-driven models, which apply machine learning to infer physical properties
from large quantities of data, have become increasingly important for
extracting stellar properties from spectra. In general, these methods have been
applied to data in one wavelength regime or another. For example, APOGEE Net
has been applied to near-IR spectra from the SDSS-V APOGEE survey to predict
stellar parameters (Teff, log g, and [Fe/H]) for all stars with Teff from 3,000
to 50,000 K, including pre-main sequence stars, OB stars, main sequence dwarfs,
and red giants. The increasing number of large surveys across multiple
wavelength regimes provides the opportunity to improve data-driven models
through learning from multiple datasets at once. In SDSS-V, a number of spectra
of stars will be observed not just with APOGEE in near-IR, but also with BOSS
in optical regime. Here we aim to develop a complementary model, BOSS Net, that
will replicate the performance of APOGEE Net in these optical data through
label transfer. We further improve the model by extending it to brown dwarfs,
as well as white dwarfs, resulting in a comprehensive coverage between
1700<Teff<100,000 K and 0<log g<10, to ensure BOSS Net can reliably measure
parameters of most of the commonly observed objects within this parameter
space. We also update APOGEE Net to achieve a comparable performance in the
near-IR regime. The resulting models provide a robust tool for measuring
stellar evolutionary states, and in turn, enable characterization of the star
forming history of the Galaxy.",2024-02-07T19:00:35Z
"Into the Darkness: Classical and Type II Cepheids in the Zona Galactica
  Incognita","The far side of the Milky Way's disk is one of the most concealed parts of
the known Universe due to extremely high interstellar extinction and point
source density toward low Galactic latitudes. Large time-domain photometric
surveys operating in the near-infrared hold great potential for the exploration
of these vast uncharted areas of our Galaxy. We conducted a census of distant
classical and type II Cepheids along the southern Galactic mid-plane using
near-infrared photometry from the VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea survey.
We performed a machine-learned classification of the Cepheids based on their
infrared light curves using a convolutional neural network. We have discovered
640 distant classical Cepheids with up to ~40 magnitudes of visual extinction,
and over 500 type II Cepheids, most of them located in the inner bulge.
Intrinsic color indices of individual Cepheids were predicted from sparse
photometric data using a neural network, allowing their use as accurate
reddening tracers. They revealed a steep, spatially varying near-infrared
extinction curve toward the inner bulge. Type II Cepheids in the Galactic bulge
were also employed to measure robust mean selective-to-absolute extinction
ratios. They trace a centrally concentrated spatial distribution of the old
bulge population with a slight elongation, consistent with earlier results from
RR Lyrae stars. Likewise, the classical Cepheids were utilized to trace the
Galactic warp and various substructures of the Galactic disk, and to uncover
significant vertical and radial age gradients of the thin disk population at
the far side of the Milky Way.",2019-08-22T10:05:42Z
"When a Period Is Not a Full Stop: Light Curve Structure Reveals
  Fundamental Parameters of Cepheid and RR Lyrae Stars","The period of pulsation and the structure of the light curve for Cepheid and
RR Lyrae variables depend on the fundamental parameters of the star: mass,
radius, luminosity, and effective temperature. Here we train artificial neural
networks on theoretical pulsation models to predict the fundamental parameters
of these stars based on their period and light curve structure. We find
significant improvements to estimates of these parameters made using light
curve structure and period over estimates made using only the period. Given
that the models are able to reproduce most observables, we find that the
fundamental parameters of these stars can be estimated up to 60% more
accurately when light curve structure is taken into consideration. We quantify
which aspects of light curve structure are most important in determining
fundamental parameters, and find for example that the second Fourier amplitude
component of RR Lyrae light curves is even more important than period in
determining the effective temperature of the star. We apply this analysis to
observations of hundreds Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud and thousands
of RR Lyrae in the Magellanic Clouds and Galactic bulge to produce catalogs of
estimated masses, radii, luminosities, and other parameters of these stars. As
an example application, we estimate Wesenheit indices and use those to derive
distance moduli to the Magellanic Clouds of $\mu_{\text{LMC},\text{CEP}} =
18.688 \pm 0.093$, $\mu_{\text{LMC},\text{RRL}} = 18.52 \pm 0.14$, and
$\mu_{\text{SMC},\text{RRL}} = 18.88 \pm 0.17$ mag.",2019-11-25T19:00:06Z
"Modeling protoplanetary disk SEDs with artificial neural networks:
  Revisiting the viscous disk model and updated disk masses","We model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 23 protoplanetary disks
in the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region using detailed disk models and a
Bayesian approach. This is made possible by combining these models with
artificial neural networks to drastically speed up their performance. Such a
setup allows us to confront $\alpha$-disk models with observations while
accounting for several uncertainties and degeneracies. Our results yield high
viscosities and accretion rates for many sources, which is not consistent with
recent measurements of low turbulence levels in disks. This inconsistency could
imply that viscosity is not the main mechanism for angular momentum transport
in disks, and that alternatives such as disk winds play an important role in
this process. We also find that our SED-derived disk masses are systematically
higher than those obtained solely from (sub)mm fluxes, suggesting that part of
the disk emission could still be optically thick at (sub)mm wavelengths. This
effect is particularly relevant for disk population studies and alleviates
previous observational tensions between the masses of protoplanetary disks and
exoplanetary systems.",2020-09-07T18:00:02Z
Optical Observations and Modeling of the Superluminous Supernova 2018lfe,"We present optical imaging and spectroscopy of SN\,2018lfe, which we classify
as a Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) at a redshift of $z = 0.3501$ with
a peak absolute magnitude of $M_r\approx -22.1$ mag, one of the brightest SLSNe
discovered. SN\,2018lfe was identified for follow-up using our FLEET machine
learning pipeline. Both the light curve and the spectra of SN\,2018lfe are
consistent with the broad population of SLSNe. We fit the light curve with a
magnetar central engine model and find an ejecta mass of $M_{\rm ej}\approx
3.8$ M$_\odot$, a magnetar spin period of $P\approx 2.9$ ms and a magnetic
field strength of $B_{\perp}\approx 2.8\times 10^{14}$ G. The magnetic field
strength is near the top of the distribution for SLSNe, while the spin period
and ejecta mass are near the median values of the distribution for SLSNe. From
late-time imaging and spectroscopy we find that the host galaxy of SN\,2018lfe
has an absolute magnitude of $M_r\approx -17.85$, ($L_B \approx 0.029$ $L^*$),
and an inferred metallicity of $Z\approx 0.3$ Z$_\odot$, and star formation
rate of $\approx 0.8$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$.",2021-09-14T21:01:02Z
"Testing Self-Organized Criticality Across the Main Sequence using
  Stellar Flares from TESS","Self-organized criticality describes a class of dynamical systems that
maintain themselves in an attractor state with no intrinsic length or time
scale. Fundamentally, this theoretical construct requires a mechanism for
instability that may trigger additional instabilities locally via dissipative
processes. This concept has been invoked to explain nonlinear dynamical
phenomena such as featureless energy spectra that have been observed
empirically for earthquakes, avalanches, and solar flares. If this
interpretation proves correct, it implies that the solar coronal magnetic field
maintains itself in a critical state via a delicate balance between the
dynamo-driven injection of magnetic energy and the release of that energy via
flaring events. All-sky high-cadence surveys like the Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite (TESS) provide the necessary data to compare the energy
distribution of flaring events in stars of different spectral types to that
observed in the Sun. We identified $\sim 10^6$ flaring events on $\sim 10^5$
stars observed by TESS at 2-minute cadence. By fitting the flare frequency
distribution for different mass bins, we find that all main sequence stars
exhibit distributions of flaring events similar to that observed in the Sun,
independent of their mass or age. This may suggest that stars universally
maintain a critical state in their coronal topologies via magnetic reconnection
events. If this interpretation proves correct, we may be able to infer
properties of magnetic fields, interior structure, and dynamo mechanisms for
stars that are otherwise unresolved point sources.",2021-09-14T23:13:00Z
"Feature Selection on a Flare Forecasting Testbed: A Comparative Study of
  24 Methods","The Space-Weather ANalytics for Solar Flares (SWAN-SF) is a multivariate time
series benchmark dataset recently created to serve the heliophysics community
as a testbed for solar flare forecasting models. SWAN-SF contains 54 unique
features, with 24 quantitative features computed from the photospheric magnetic
field maps of active regions, describing their precedent flare activity. In
this study, for the first time, we systematically attacked the problem of
quantifying the relevance of these features to the ambitious task of flare
forecasting. We implemented an end-to-end pipeline for preprocessing, feature
selection, and evaluation phases. We incorporated 24 Feature Subset Selection
(FSS) algorithms, including multivariate and univariate, supervised and
unsupervised, wrappers and filters. We methodologically compared the results of
different FSS algorithms, both on the multivariate time series and vectorized
formats, and tested their correlation and reliability, to the extent possible,
by using the selected features for flare forecasting on unseen data, in
univariate and multivariate fashions. We concluded our investigation with a
report of the best FSS methods in terms of their top-k features, and the
analysis of the findings. We wish the reproducibility of our study and the
availability of the data allow the future attempts be comparable with our
findings and themselves.",2021-09-30T00:23:09Z
Measuring chemical likeness of stars with RSCA,"Identification of chemically similar stars using elemental abundances is core
to many pursuits within Galactic archaeology. However, measuring the chemical
likeness of stars using abundances directly is limited by systematic imprints
of imperfect synthetic spectra in abundance derivation. We present a novel
data-driven model that is capable of identifying chemically similar stars from
spectra alone. We call this Relevant Scaled Component Analysis (RSCA). RSCA
finds a mapping from stellar spectra to a representation that optimizes
recovery of known open clusters. By design, RSCA amplifies factors of chemical
abundance variation and minimizes those of non-chemical parameters, such as
instrument systematics. The resultant representation of stellar spectra can
therefore be used for precise measurements of chemical similarity between
stars. We validate RSCA using 185 cluster stars in 22 open clusters in the
APOGEE survey. We quantify our performance in measuring chemical similarity
using a reference set of 151,145 field stars. We find that our representation
identifies known stellar siblings more effectively than stellar abundance
measurements. Using RSCA, 1.8% of pairs of field stars are as similar as birth
siblings, compared to 2.3% when using stellar abundance labels. We find that
almost all of the information within spectra leveraged by RSCA fits into a
two-dimensional basis, which we link to [Fe/H] and alpha-element abundances. We
conclude that chemical tagging of stars to their birth clusters remains
prohibitive. However, using the spectra has noticeable gain, and our approach
is poised to benefit from larger datasets and improved algorithm designs.",2021-10-05T18:03:59Z
"Identifications of RR Lyrae stars and Quasars from the simulated data of
  Mephisto-W Survey","We have investigated the feasibilities and accuracies of the identifications
of RR Lyrae stars and quasars from the simulated data of the Multi-channel
Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) W Survey. Based on the variable sources
light curve libraries from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 data
and the observation history simulation from the Mephisto-W Survey Scheduler, we
have simulated the $uvgriz$ multi-band light curves of RR Lyrae stars, quasars
and other variable sources for the first year observation of Mephisto-W Survey.
We have applied the ensemble machine learning algorithm Random Forest
Classifier (RFC) to identify RR Lyrae stars and quasars, respectively. We build
training and test samples and extract ~ 150 features from the simulated light
curves and train two RFCs respectively for the RR Lyrae star and quasar
classification. We find that, our RFCs are able to select the RR Lyrae stars
and quasars with remarkably high precision and completeness, with $purity$ =
95.4 per cent and $completeness$ = 96.9 per cent for the RR Lyrae RFC and
$purity$ = 91.4 per cent and $completeness$ = 90.2 per cent for the quasar RFC.

"Investigation of stellar magnetic activity using variational autoencoder
  based on low-resolution spectroscopic survey","We apply the variational autoencoder (VAE) to the LAMOST-K2 low-resolution
spectra to detect the magnetic activity of the stars in the K2 field. After the
training on the spectra of the selected inactive stars, the VAE model can
efficiently generate the synthetic reference templates needed by the spectral
subtraction procedure, without knowing any stellar parameters. Then we detect
the peculiar spectral features, such as chromospheric emissions, strong nebular
emissions and lithium absorptions, in our sample. We measure the emissions of
the chromospheric activity indicators, H$\alpha$ and Ca II infrared triplet
(IRT) lines, to quantify the stellar magnetic activity. The excess emissions of
H$\alpha$ and Ca II IRT lines of the active stars are correlated well to the
rotational periods and the amplitudes of light curves derived from the K2
photometry. We degrade the LAMOST spectra to simulate the slitless spectra of
the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) and apply the VAE to the simulated
data. For cool active stars, we reveal a good agreement between the equivalent
widths (EWs) of H$\alpha$ line derived from the spectra with two resolutions.
The result indicates the ability of identifying the magnetically active stars
in the future CSST survey, which will deliver an unprecedented large database
of low-resolution spectra as well as simultaneous multi-band photometry of
stars.",2022-06-15T02:41:00Z
"FERIA: Flat Envelope Model with Rotation and Infall under Angular

have rapidly progressed since the advent of Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). A gas distribution and its kinematics
within a few 100s au scale around a Class 0-I protostar are spatially resolved,
and the region where a protostellar disk is being formed is now revealed in
detail. In such studies, it is essential to characterize the complex physical
structure around a protostar consisting of an infalling envelope, a
rotationally-supported disk, and an outflow. For this purpose, we have
developed a general-purpose computer code `{\tt FERIA}' (Flat Envelope model

image cube data based on the infalling-rotating envelope model and the
Keplerian disk model, both of which are often used in observational studies. In
this paper, we present the description and the usage manual of {\tt FERIA} and
summarize caveats in actual applications. This program outputs cube {\tt FITS}

"First results of the glitching pulsars monitoring program at the
  Argentine Institute of Radioastronomy","We report here on the first results of a systematic monitoring of southern

individual pulses study of Vela in observations before and after the glitch. We
selected 6 days of observations around the major glitch on 2021 July 22 and

"Attention-Based Generative Neural Image Compression on Solar Dynamics
  Observatory","NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission gathers 1.4 terabytes of data
each day from its geosynchronous orbit in space. SDO data includes images of
the Sun captured at different wavelengths, with the primary scientific goal of
understanding the dynamic processes governing the Sun. Recently, end-to-end
optimized artificial neural networks (ANN) have shown great potential in
performing image compression. ANN-based compression schemes have outperformed
conventional hand-engineered algorithms for lossy and lossless image
compression. We have designed an ad-hoc ANN-based image compression scheme to
reduce the amount of data needed to be stored and retrieved on space missions
studying solar dynamics. In this work, we propose an attention module to make
use of both local and non-local attention mechanisms in an adversarially
trained neural image compression network. We have also demonstrated the
superior perceptual quality of this neural image compressor. Our proposed
algorithm for compressing images downloaded from the SDO spacecraft performs
better in rate-distortion trade-off than the popular currently-in-use image
compression codecs such as JPEG and JPEG2000. In addition we have shown that
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the art lossy transform coding

"Inferring the impact of feedback on the matter distribution using the
  Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect: Insights from CAMELS simulations and ACT+DES data","Feedback from active galactic nuclei and stellar processes changes the matter
distribution on small scales, leading to significant systematic uncertainty in
weak lensing constraints on cosmology. We investigate how the observable
properties of group-scale halos can constrain feedback's impact on the matter
distribution using Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations
(CAMELS). Extending the results of previous work to smaller halo masses and
higher wavenumber, $k$, we find that the baryon fraction in halos contains
significant information about the impact of feedback on the matter power
spectrum. We explore how the thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich (tSZ) signal from
group-scale halos contains similar information. Using recent Dark Energy Survey
(DES) weak lensing and Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) tSZ cross-correlation
measurements and models trained on CAMELS, we obtain $10\%$ constraints on
feedback effects on the power spectrum at $k \sim 5\, h/{\rm Mpc}$. We show
that with future surveys, it will be possible to constrain baryonic effects on
the power spectrum to $\mathcal{O}(<1\%)$ at $k = 1\, h/{\rm Mpc}$ and
$\mathcal{O}(3\%)$ at $k = 5\, h/{\rm Mpc}$ using the methods that we introduce
here. Finally, we investigate the impact of feedback on the matter bispectrum,
finding that tSZ observables are highly informative in this case.",2023-01-05T17:51:24Z
Automated classification of eclipsing binary systems in the VVV Survey,"With the advent of large-scale photometric surveys of the sky, modern science
witnesses the dawn of big data astronomy, where automatic handling and

The VISTA Variables of the V\'ia L\'actea Survey, in the southern part of the
Galactic disc, comprises multi-epoch photometric data necessary for the
potential discovery of variable objects, including eclipsing binary systems

well as the history of stellar mass accretion typically involve the numerical
solution of complex systems of coupled differential equations. The resulting
mass accretion history of protostars is known to be highly episodic due to
recurrent instabilities and also exhibits short timescale flickering. By
leveraging the strong predictive abilities of neural networks, we extract some
of the critical temporal dynamics experienced during the mass accretion
including periods of instability. Particularly, we utilize a novel form of the
Echo-State Neural Network (ESN), which has been shown to efficiently deal with
data having inherent nonlinearity. We introduce the use of Optimized-ESN
(Opt-ESN) to make model-independent time series forecasting of mass accretion
rate in the evolution of protostellar disks. We apply the network to multiple
hydrodynamic simulations with different initial conditions and exhibiting a
variety of temporal dynamics to demonstrate the predictability of the Opt-ESN
model. The model is trained on simulation data of $\sim 1-2$ Myr, and achieves
predictions with a low normalized mean square error ($\sim 10^{-5}$ to
$10^{-3}$) for forecasts ranging between 100 and 3800 yr. This result shows the
promise of the application of machine learning based models to time-domain
astronomy.",2023-02-07T20:46:23Z
Sparse logistic regression for RR Lyrae vs binaries classification,"RR Lyrae (RRL) are old, low-mass radially pulsating variable stars in their
core helium burning phase. They are popular stellar tracers and primary
distance indicators, since they obey to well defined period-luminosity
relations in the near-infrared regime. Their photometric identification is not
trivial, indeed, RRL samples can be contaminated by eclipsing binaries,
especially in large datasets produced by fully automatic pipelines.
Interpretable machine-learning approaches for separating eclipsing binaries
from RRL are thus needed. Ideally, they should be able to achieve high
precision in identifying RRL while generalizing to new data from different
instruments. In this paper, we train a simple logistic regression classifier on
Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) light curves. It achieves a precision of 87% at 78%
recall for the RRL class on unseen CSS light curves. It generalizes on
out-of-sample data (ASAS/ASAS-SN light curves) with a precision of 85% at 96%
recall. We also considered a L1-regularized version of our classifier, which
reaches 90% sparsity in the light-curve features with a limited trade-off in
accuracy on our CSS validation set and -- remarkably -- also on the
ASAS/ASAS-SN light curve test set. Logistic regression is natively
interpretable, and regularization allows us to point out the parts of the light
curves that matter the most in classification. We thus achieved both good
generalization and full interpretability.",2023-04-24T18:00:07Z
An Evenly-Spaced LSST Cadence for Rapidly Variable Stars,"Stars exhibit a bewildering variety of rapidly variable behaviors ranging
from explosive magnetic flares to stochastically changing accretion to periodic
pulsations or rotation. The principal Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space
and Time (LSST) surveys will have cadences too sparse and irregular to capture
many of these phenomena. We propose here a LSST micro-survey to observe a
single Galactic field, rich in unobscured stars, in a continuous sequence of 30
second exposures for one long winter night in a single photometric band. The
result will be a unique dataset of $\sim 1$ million regularly spaced stellar
light curves (LCs). The LCs will constitute a comprehensive collection of
late-type stellar flaring, but also other classes like short-period binary
systems and cataclysmic variables, young stellar objects and ultra-short period
exoplanets. An unknown variety of anomalous Solar System, Galactic and
extragalactic variables and transients may also be present. A powerful array of
statistical procedures can be applied to individual LCs from the long-standing
fields of time series analysis, signal processing and econometrics. Dozens of
`features' describing the variability can be extracted and the ensemble of
light curves can be subject to advanced machine learning clustering procedures.
This will give a unique, authoritative, objective taxonomy of the rapidly
variable sky derived from identically cadenced LCs. This micro-survey is best
performed early in the Rubin Observatory program, and the results can inform
the wider community on the best approaches to variable star identification and
classification from the sparse, irregular cadences that dominate the planned
surveys.",2023-08-01T02:12:03Z

"$\texttt{slick}$: Modeling a Universe of Molecular Line Luminosities in
  Hydrodynamical Simulations","We present {\sc slick} (the Scalable Line Intensity Computation Kit), a
software package that calculates realistic CO, [\ion{C}{1}], and [\ion{C}{2}]
luminosities for clouds and galaxies formed in hydrodynamic simulations. Built
on the radiative transfer code {\sc despotic}, {\sc slick} computes the
thermal, radiative, and statistical equilibrium in concentric zones of model
clouds, based on their physical properties and individual environments. We
validate our results applying {\sc slick} to the high-resolution run of the
{\sc Simba} simulations, testing the derived luminosities against empirical and
theoretical/analytic relations. To simulate the line emission from a universe
of emitting clouds, we have incorporated random forest machine learning (ML)
methods into our approach, allowing us to predict cosmologically evolving
properties of CO, [\ion{C}{1}] and [\ion{C}{2}] emission from galaxies such as
luminosity functions. We tested this model in 100,000 gas particles, and 2,500
galaxies, reaching an average accuracy of $\sim$99.8\% for all lines. Finally,
we present the first model light cones created with realistic and ML-predicted
CO, [\ion{C}{1}], and [\ion{C}{2}] luminosities in cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations, from $z=0$ to $z=10$.",2023-11-02T18:00:08Z
"A Quantum Fuzzy-based Approach for Real-Time Detection of Solar Coronal
  Holes","The detection and analysis of the solar coronal holes (CHs) is an important
field of study in the domain of solar physics. Mainly, it is required for the
proper prediction of the geomagnetic storms which directly or indirectly affect
various space and ground-based systems. For the detection of CHs till date, the
solar scientist depends on manual hand-drawn approaches. However, with the
advancement of image processing technologies, some automated image segmentation
methods have been used for the detection of CHs. In-spite of this, fast and
accurate detection of CHs are till a major issues. Here in this work, a novel
quantum computing-based fast fuzzy c-mean technique has been developed for fast
detection of the CHs region. The task has been carried out in two stages, in
first stage the solar image has been segmented using a quantum computing based
fast fuzzy c-mean (QCFFCM) and in the later stage the CHs has been extracted
out from the segmented image based on image morphological operation. In the
work, quantum computing has been used to optimize the cost function of the fast
fuzzy c-mean (FFCM) algorithm, where quantum approximate optimization algorithm
(QAOA) has been used to optimize the quadratic part of the cost function. The
proposed method has been tested for 193 \AA{} SDO/AIA full-disk solar image
datasets and has been compared with the existing techniques. The outcome shows
the comparable performance of the proposed method with the existing one within
a very lesser time.",2024-03-27T08:38:56Z
"A Data-Driven Search For Mid-Infrared Excesses Among Five Million
  Main-Sequence FGK Stars","Stellar infrared excesses can indicate various phenomena of interest, from
protoplanetary disks to debris disks, or (more speculatively) techno-signatures
along the lines of Dyson spheres. In this paper, we conduct a large search for
such excesses, designed as a data-driven contextual anomaly detection pipeline.
We focus our search on FGK stars close to the main sequence to favour non-young
host stars. We look for excess in the mid-infrared, unlocking a large sample to
search in while favouring extreme IR excess akin to the ones produced by
Extreme Debris Disks (EDD). We combine observations from ESA Gaia DR3, 2MASS,
and the unWISE of NASA WISE, and create a catalogue of 4,898,812 stars with $G
< 16$ mag. We consider a star to have an excess if it is substantially brighter
in $W1$ and $W2$ bands than what is predicted from an ensemble of
machine-learning models trained on the data, taking optical and near-infrared
information as input features. We apply a set of additional cuts (derived from
the ML models and the objects' astronomical features) to avoid false-positive
and identify a set of 53 objects (a rate of $1.1\times 10^{-5}$), including one
previously identified EDD candidate. Typical infrared-excess fractional
luminosities we find are in the range 0.005 to 0.1, consistent with known EDDs.",2024-03-27T18:39:11Z
"STag II: Classification of Serendipitous Supernovae Observed by Galaxy
  Redshift Surveys","With the number of supernovae observed expected to drastically increase
thanks to large-scale surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument
(DESI), it is necessary that the tools we use to classify these objects keep up
with this increase. We previously created Supernova Tagging and Classification
(STag) to address this problem by employing machine learning techniques
alongside logistic regression in order to assign 'tags' to spectra based on
spectral features. STag II is a continuation of this work, which now makes use
of model supernova spectra combined with real DESI spectra in order to train
STag to better deal with realistic data. We also make use of the rlap score as
a trustworthiness cut, making for a more robust and accurate supernova
classifier than before.",2024-06-25T01:16:30Z
"A Machine-Learning-Ready Dataset Prepared from the Solar and
  Heliospheric Observatory Mission","We present a Python tool to generate a standard dataset from solar images
that allows for user-defined selection criteria and a range of pre-processing
steps. Our Python tool works with all image products from both the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) missions.
We discuss a dataset produced from the SoHO mission's multi-spectral images
which is free of missing or corrupt data as well as planetary transits in
coronagraph images, and is temporally synced making it ready for input to a
machine learning system. Machine-learning-ready images are a valuable resource
for the community because they can be used, for example, for forecasting space
weather parameters. We illustrate the use of this data with a 3-5 day-ahead
forecast of the north-south component of the interplanetary magnetic field
(IMF) observed at Lagrange point one (L1). For this use case, we apply a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) to a subset of the full SoHO dataset and
compare with baseline results from a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier.",2021-08-04T21:23:29Z
"The Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE)
  Alert Broker","We introduce the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events
(ALeRCE) broker, an astronomical alert broker designed to provide a rapid and
self--consistent classification of large etendue telescope alert streams, such
as that provided by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and, in the future, the
Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). ALeRCE is a
Chilean--led broker run by an interdisciplinary team of astronomers and
engineers, working to become intermediaries between survey and follow--up
facilities. ALeRCE uses a pipeline which includes the real--time ingestion,
aggregation, cross--matching, machine learning (ML) classification, and
visualization of the ZTF alert stream. We use two classifiers: a stamp--based
classifier, designed for rapid classification, and a light--curve--based
classifier, which uses the multi--band flux evolution to achieve a more refined
classification. We describe in detail our pipeline, data products, tools and
services, which are made public for the community (see
\url{https://alerce.science}). Since we began operating our real--time ML
classification of the ZTF alert stream in early 2019, we have grown a large
community of active users around the globe. We describe our results to date,
including the real--time processing of $9.7\times10^7$ alerts, the stamp
classification of $1.9\times10^7$ objects, the light curve classification of
$8.5\times10^5$ objects, the report of 3088 supernova candidates, and different
experiments using LSST-like alert streams. Finally, we discuss the challenges
ahead to go from a single-stream of alerts such as ZTF to a multi--stream
ecosystem dominated by LSST.",2020-08-07T18:00:00Z
"A Bayesian method for the analysis of deterministic and stochastic time
  series","I introduce a general, Bayesian method for modelling univariate time series
data assumed to be drawn from a continuous, stochastic process. The method
accommodates arbitrary temporal sampling, and takes into account measurement
uncertainties for arbitrary error models (not just Gaussian) on both the time
and signal variables. Any model for the deterministic component of the
variation of the signal with time is supported, as is any model of the
stochastic component on the signal and time variables. Models illustrated here
are constant and sinusoidal models for the signal mean combined with a Gaussian
stochastic component, as well as a purely stochastic model, the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The posterior probability distribution over model
parameters is determined via Monte Carlo sampling. Models are compared using
the ""cross-validation likelihood"", in which the posterior-averaged likelihood
for different partitions of the data are combined. In principle this is more
robust to changes in the prior than is the evidence (the prior-averaged
likelihood). The method is demonstrated by applying it to the light curves of
11 ultra cool dwarf stars, claimed by a previous study to show statistically
significant variability. This is reassessed here by calculating the
cross-validation likelihood for various time series models, including a null
hypothesis of no variability beyond the error bars. 10 of 11 light curves are
confirmed as being significantly variable, and one of these seems to be
periodic, with two plausible periods identified. Another object is best
described by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, a conclusion which is obviously
limited to the set of models actually tested.",2012-09-17T17:44:29Z
OGLE-IV Real-Time Transient Search,"We present the design and first results of a real-time search for transients
within the 650 sq. deg. area around the Magellanic Clouds, conducted as part of
the OGLE-IV project and aimed at detecting supernovae, novae and other events.
The average sampling of about 4 days from September to May, yielded a detection
of 238 transients in 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 seasons. The superb photometric
and astrometric quality of the OGLE data allows for numerous applications of
the discovered transients.
  We use this sample to prepare and train a Machine Learning-based automated
classifier for early light curves, which distinguishes major classes of
transients with more than 80% of correct answers. Spectroscopically classified
49 supernovae Type Ia are used to construct a Hubble Diagram with statistical
scatter of about 0.3 mag and fill the least populated region of the redshifts
range in the Union sample. We investigate the influence of host galaxy
environments on supernovae statistics and find the mean host extinction of
A_I=0.19+-0.10 mag and A_V=0.39+-0.21 mag based on a subsample of supernovae
Type Ia. We show that the positional accuracy of the survey is of the order of
0.5 pixels (0.13 arcsec) and that the OGLE-IV Transient Detection System is
capable of detecting transients within the nuclei of galaxies. We present a few
interesting cases of nuclear transients of unknown type.
  All data on the OGLE transients are made publicly available to the
astronomical community via the OGLE website.",2014-09-03T14:10:27Z
Testing the chemical tagging technique with open clusters,"Context. Stars are born together from giant molecular clouds and, if we
assume that the priors were chemically homogeneous and well-mixed, we expect
them to share the same chemical composition. Most of the stellar aggregates are
disrupted while orbiting the Galaxy and most of the dynamic information is
lost, thus the only possibility of reconstructing the stellar formation history
is to analyze the chemical abundances that we observe today.
  Aims. The chemical tagging technique aims to recover disrupted stellar
clusters based merely on their chemical composition. We evaluate the viability
of this technique to recover co-natal stars that are no longer gravitationally
bound.
  Methods. Open clusters are co-natal aggregates that have managed to survive
together. We compiled stellar spectra from 31 old and intermediate-age open
clusters, homogeneously derived atmospheric parameters, and 17 abundance
species, and applied machine learning algorithms to group the stars based on
their chemical composition. This approach allows us to evaluate the viability
and efficiency of the chemical tagging technique.
  Results. We found that stars at different evolutionary stages have distinct
chemical patterns that may be due to NLTE effects, atomic diffusion, mixing,
and biases. When separating stars into dwarfs and giants, we observed that a
few open clusters show distinct chemical signatures while the majority show a
high degree of overlap. This limits the recovery of co-natal aggregates by
applying the chemical tagging technique. Nevertheless, there is room for
improvement if more elements are included and models are improved.",2015-03-06T21:00:16Z
"Investigating the Kinematics of Coronal Mass Ejections with the
  Automated CORIMP Catalog","Studying coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in coronagraph data can be challenging
due to their diffuse structure and transient nature, compounded by the
variations in their dynamics, morphology, and frequency of occurrence. The
large amounts of data available from missions like the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO) make manual cataloging of CMEs tedious and prone to human
error, and so a robust method of detection and analysis is required and often
preferred. A new coronal image processing catalog called CORIMP has been
developed in an effort to achieve this, through the implementation of a dynamic
background separation technique and multiscale edge detection. These algorithms
together isolate and characterise CME structure in the field-of-view of the
Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard SOHO. CORIMP also applies
a Savitzky-Golay filter, along with quadratic and linear fits, to the
height-time measurements for better revealing the true CME speed and
acceleration profiles across the plane-of-sky. Here we present a sample of new
results from the CORIMP CME catalog, and directly compare them with the other
automated catalogs of Computer Aided CME Tracking (CACTus) and Solar Eruptive
Events Detection System (SEEDS), as well as the manual CME catalog at the
Coordinated Data Analysis Workshop (CDAW) Data Center and a previously
published study of the sample events. We further investigate a form of
unsupervised machine learning by using a k-means clustering algorithm to
distinguish detections of multiple CMEs that occur close together in space and
time. While challenges still exist, this investigation and comparison of
results demonstrates the reliability and robustness of the CORIMP catalog,
proving its effectiveness at detecting and tracking CMEs throughout the LASCO
dataset.",2015-06-12T15:39:27Z
Hot Subdwarf All Southern Sky Fast Transit Survey with the Evryscope,"We have conducted a survey of candidate hot subdwarf stars in the southern
sky searching for fast transits, eclipses, and sinusoidal like variability in
the Evryscope light curves. The survey aims to detect transit signals from
Neptune size planets to gas-giants, and eclipses from M-dwarfs and brown
dwarfs. The other variability signals are primarily expected to be from compact
binaries and reflection effect binaries. Due to the small size of hot
subdwarfs, transit and eclipse signals are expected to last only twenty
minutes, but with large signal depths (up to completely eclipsing if the
orientation is edge on). With its 2-minute cadence and continuous observing
Evryscope is well placed to recover these fast transits and eclipses. The very
large field of view (8150 sq. deg.) is critical to obtain enough hot subdwarf
targets, despite their rarity. We identified 11,000 potential hot subdwarfs
from the 9.3M Evryscope light curves for sources brighter than mg = 15. With
our machine learning spectral classifier, we flagged high-confidence targets
and estimate the total hot subdwarfs in the survey to be 1400. The light curve
search detected three planet transit candidates, shown to have stellar
companions from followup analysis. We discovered several new compact binaries
(including two with unseen degenerate companions, and several others with
potentially rare secondaries), two eclipsing binaries with M-dwarf companions,
as well as new reflection effect binaries and others with sinusoidal like
variability. The hot subdwarf discoveries identified here are spectroscopically
confirmed and we verified the Evryscope discovery light curve with TESS light
curves when available. Four of the discoveries are in the process of being
published in separate followup papers, and we discuss the followup potential of
several of the other discoveries.",2019-12-23T17:44:36Z
Prediction of Dst during solar minimum using in situ measurements at L5,"Geomagnetic storms resulting from high-speed streams can have significant
negative impacts on modern infrastructure due to complex interactions between
the solar wind and geomagnetic field. One measure of the extent of this effect
is the Kyoto $Dst$ index. We present a method to predict $Dst$ from data
measured at the Lagrange 5 (L5) point, which allows for forecasts of solar wind
development 4.5 days in advance of the stream reaching the Earth. Using the
STEREO-B satellite as a proxy, we map data measured near L5 to the near-Earth
environment and make a prediction of the $Dst$ from this point using the
Temerin-Li $Dst$ model enhanced from the original using a machine learning
approach. We evaluate the method accuracy with both traditional point-to-point
error measures and an event-based validation approach. The results show that
predictions using L5 data outperform a 27-day solar wind persistence model in
all validation measures but do not achieve a level similar to an L1 monitor.
Offsets in timing and the rapidly-changing development of $B_z$ in comparison
to $B_x$ and $B_y$ reduce the accuracy. Predictions of $Dst$ from L5 have an
RMSE of $9$ nT, which is double the error of $4$ nT using measurements
conducted near the Earth. The most useful application of L5 measurements is
shown to be in predicting the minimum $Dst$ for the next four days. This method
is being implemented in a real-time forecast setting using STEREO-A as an L5
proxy, and has implications for the usefulness of future L5 missions.",2020-05-01T07:08:39Z
"Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU):Compact radio sources in the
  SCORPIO field towards the Galactic plane","We present observations of a region of the Galactic plane taken during the
Early Science Program of the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder
(ASKAP). In this context, we observed the SCORPIO field at 912 MHz with an
uncompleted array consisting of 15 commissioned antennas. The resulting map
covers a square region of ~40 deg^2, centred on (l, b)=(343.5{\deg},
0.75{\deg}), with a synthesized beam of 24""x21"" and a background rms noise of
150-200 {\mu}Jy/beam, increasing to 500-600 {\mu}Jy/beam close to the Galactic
plane. A total of 3963 radio sources were detected and characterized in the
field using the CAESAR source finder. We obtained differential source counts in
agreement with previously published data after correction for source extraction
and characterization uncertainties, estimated from simulated data. The ASKAP
positional and flux density scale accuracy were also investigated through
comparison with previous surveys (MGPS, NVSS) and additional observations of
the SCORPIO field, carried out with ATCA at 2.1 GHz and 10"" spatial resolution.
These allowed us to obtain a measurement of the spectral index for a subset of
the catalogued sources and an estimated fraction of (at least) 8% of resolved
sources in the reported catalogue. We cross-matched our catalogued sources with
different astronomical databases to search for possible counterparts, finding
~150 associations to known Galactic objects. Finally, we explored a
multiparametric approach for classifying previously unreported Galactic sources
based on their radio-infrared colors.",2021-01-11T12:25:32Z
Using Data Imputation for Signal Separation in High Contrast Imaging,"To characterize circumstellar systems in high contrast imaging, the
fundamental step is to construct a best point spread function (PSF) template
for the non-circumstellar signals (i.e., star light and speckles) and separate
it from the observation. With existing PSF construction methods, the
circumstellar signals (e.g., planets, circumstellar disks) are unavoidably
altered by over-fitting and/or self-subtraction, making forward modeling a
necessity to recover these signals. We present a forward modeling--free
solution to these problems with data imputation using sequential non-negative
matrix factorization (DI-sNMF). DI-sNMF first converts this signal separation
problem to a ""missing data"" problem in statistics by flagging the regions which
host circumstellar signals as missing data, then attributes PSF signals to
these regions. We mathematically prove it to have negligible alteration to
circumstellar signals when the imputation region is relatively small, which
thus enables precise measurement for these circumstellar objects. We apply it
to simulated point source and circumstellar disk observations to demonstrate
its proper recovery of them. We apply it to Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) K1-band
observations of the debris disk surrounding HR 4796A, finding a tentative trend
that the dust is more forward scattering as the wavelength increases. We expect
DI-sNMF to be applicable to other general scenarios where the separation of
signals is needed.",2020-01-02T18:55:18Z
"Estimating activity cycles with probabilistic methods I. Bayesian
  Generalised Lomb-Scargle Periodogram with Trend","Period estimation is one of the central topics in astronomical time series
analysis, where data is often unevenly sampled. Especially challenging are
studies of stellar magnetic cycles, as there the periods looked for are of the
order of the same length than the datasets themselves. The datasets often
contain trends, the origin of which is either a real long-term cycle or an
instrumental effect, but these effects cannot be reliably separated, while they
can lead to erroneous period determinations if not properly handled. In this
study we aim at developing a method that can handle the trends properly, and by
performing extensive set of testing, we show that this is the optimal procedure
when contrasted with methods that do not include the trend directly to the
model. The effect of the form of the noise (whether constant or
heteroscedastic) on the results is also investigated. We introduce a Bayesian
Generalised Lomb-Scargle Periodogram with Trend (BGLST), which is a
probabilistic linear regression model using Gaussian priors for the
coefficients and uniform prior for the frequency parameter. We show, using
synthetic data, that when there is no prior information on whether and to what
extent the true model of the data contains a linear trend, the introduced BGLST
method is preferable to the methods which either detrend the data or leave the
data untrended before fitting the periodic model. Whether to use noise with
different than constant variance in the model depends on the density of the
data sampling as well as on the true noise type of the process.",2017-12-21T22:16:14Z
"Estimating activity cycles with probabilistic methods II. The Mount
  Wilson Ca H&K data","Debate over the existence of branches in the stellar activity-rotation
diagrams continues. Application of modern time series analysis tools to study
the mean cycle periods in chromospheric activity index is lacking. We develop
such models, based on Gaussian processes, for one-dimensional time series and
apply it to the extended Mount Wilson Ca H&K sample. Our main aim is to study
how the previously commonly used assumption of strict harmonicity of the
stellar cycles as well as handling of the linear trends affects the results. We
introduce three methods of different complexity, starting with the simple
Bayesian harmonic model and followed by Gaussian Process models with periodic
and quasi-periodic covariance functions. We confirm the existence of two
populations in the activity-period diagram. We find only one significant trend
in the inactive population, namely that the cycle periods get shorter with
increasing rotation. This is in contrast with earlier studies, that postulate
the existence of trends in both of the populations. In terms of rotation to
cycle period ratio, our data is consistent with only two activity branches such
that the active branch merges together with the transitional one. The retrieved
stellar cycles are uniformly distributed over the R'HK activity index,
indicating that the operation of stellar large-scale dynamos carries smoothly
over the Vaughan-Preston gap. At around the solar activity index, however,
indications of a disruption in the cyclic dynamo action are seen. Our study
shows that stellar cycle estimates depend significantly on the model applied.
Such model-dependent aspects include the improper treatment of linear trends,
while the assumption of strict harmonicity can result in the appearance of
double cyclicities that seem more likely to be explained by the
quasi-periodicity of the cycles.",2017-12-21T22:40:45Z
A census of $ρ$ Oph candidate members from Gaia DR2,"The Ophiuchus cloud complex is one of the best laboratories to study the
earlier stages of the stellar and protoplanetary disc evolution. The wealth of
accurate astrometric measurements contained in the Gaia Data Release 2 can be
used to update the census of Ophiuchus member candidates. We seek to find
potential new members of Ophiuchus and identify those surrounded by a
circumstellar disc. We constructed a control sample composed of 188 bona fide
Ophiuchus members. Using this sample as a reference we applied three different
density-based machine learning clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, OPTICS, and
HDBSCAN) to a sample drawn from the Gaia catalogue centred on the Ophiuchus
cloud. The clustering analysis was applied in the five astrometric dimensions
defined by the three-dimensional Cartesian space and the proper motions in
right ascension and declination. The three clustering algorithms systematically
identify a similar set of candidate members in a main cluster with astrometric
properties consistent with those of the control sample. The increased
flexibility of the OPTICS and HDBSCAN algorithms enable these methods to
identify a secondary cluster. We constructed a common sample containing 391
member candidates including 166 new objects, which have not yet been discussed
in the literature. By combining the Gaia data with 2MASS and WISE photometry,
we built the spectral energy distributions from 0.5 to $22\microm$ for a subset
of 48 objects and found a total of 41 discs, including 11 Class II and 1 Class
III new discs. Density-based clustering algorithms are a promising tool to
identify candidate members of star forming regions in large astrometric
databases. If confirmed, the candidate members discussed in this work would
represent an increment of roughly 40% of the current census of Ophiuchus.",2019-02-20T15:37:05Z
Multi-layered characterization of hot stellar systems with confidence,"Understanding the physical and evolutionary properties of Hot Stellar Systems
(HSS) is a major challenge in astronomy. We studied the dataset on 13456 HSS of
Misgeld and Hilker (2011) that includes 12763 candidate globular clusters using
stellar mass ($M_s$), effective radius ($R_e$) and mass-to-luminosity ratio
($M_s/L_\nu$), and found multi-layered homogeneous grouping among these stellar
systems. Our methods elicited eight homogeneous ellipsoidal groups at the
finest sub-group level. Some of these groups have high overlap and were merged
through a multi-phased syncytial algorithm motivated from Almod\'ovar-Rivera
and Maitra (2020). Five groups were merged in the first phase, resulting in
three complex-structured groups. Our algorithm determined further complex
structure and permitted another merging phase, revealing two complex-structured
groups at the highest level. A nonparametric bootstrap procedure was also used
to estimate the confidence of each of our group assignments. These assignments
generally had high confidence in classification, indicating great degree of
certainty of the HSS assignments into our complex-structured groups. The
physical and kinematic properties of the two groups were assessed in terms of
$M_s$, $R_e$, surface density and $M_s/L_\nu$. The first group consisted of
older, smaller and less bright HSS while the second group consisted of brighter
and younger HSS. Our analysis provides novel insight into the physical and
evolutionary properties of HSS and also helps understand physical and
evolutionary properties of candidate globular clusters. Further, the candidate
globular clusters (GCs) are seen to have very high chance of really being GCs
rather than dwarfs or dwarf ellipticals that are also indicated to be quite
distinct from each other.",2020-03-12T13:12:14Z
Design and operation of the ATLAS Transient Science Server,"The Asteroid Terrestrial impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) system consists of
two 0.5m Schmidt telescopes with cameras covering 29 square degrees at plate
scale of 1.86 arcsec per pixel. Working in tandem, the telescopes routinely
survey the whole sky visible from Hawaii (above $\delta > -50^{\circ}$) every
two nights, exposing four times per night, typically reaching $o < 19$
magnitude per exposure when the moon is illuminated and $c < 19.5$ per exposure
in dark skies. Construction is underway of two further units to be sited in
Chile and South Africa which will result in an all-sky daily cadence from 2021.
Initially designed for detecting potentially hazardous near earth objects, the
ATLAS data enable a range of astrophysical time domain science. To extract
transients from the data stream requires a computing system to process the
data, assimilate detections in time and space and associate them with known
astrophysical sources. Here we describe the hardware and software
infrastructure to produce a stream of clean, real, astrophysical transients in
real time. This involves machine learning and boosted decision tree algorithms
to identify extragalactic and Galactic transients. Typically we detect 10-15
supernova candidates per night which we immediately announce publicly. The
ATLAS discoveries not only enable rapid follow-up of interesting sources but
will provide complete statistical samples within the local volume of 100 Mpc. A
simple comparison of the detected supernova rate within 100 Mpc, with no
corrections for completeness, is already significantly higher (factor 1.5 to 2)
than the current accepted rates.",2020-03-20T00:20:36Z
Improving solar wind forecasting using Data Assimilation,"Data Assimilation (DA) has enabled huge improvements in the skill of
terrestrial operational weather forecasting. In this study, we use a
variational DA scheme with a computationally efficient solar wind model and in
situ observations from STEREO-A, STEREO-B and ACE. This scheme enables
solar-wind observations far from the Sun, such as at 1 AU, to update and
improve the inner boundary conditions of the solar wind model (at 30 solar
radii). In this way, observational information can be used to improve estimates
of the near-Earth solar wind, even when the observations are not directly
downstream of the Earth. This allows improved initial conditions of the solar
wind to be passed into forecasting models. To this effect, we employ the HUXt
solar wind model to produce 27-day forecasts of the solar wind during the
operational lifetime of STEREO-B (01 November 2007 - 30 September 2014). In
near-Earth space, we compare the accuracy of these DA forecasts with both
non-DA forecasts and simple corotation of STEREO-B observations. We find that
27-day root mean-square error (RMSE) for STEREO-B corotation and DA forecasts
are comparable and both are significantly lower than non-DA forecasts. However,
the DA forecast is shown to improve solar wind forecasts when STEREO-B's
latitude is offset from Earth, which is an issue for corotation forecasts. And
the DA scheme enables the representation of the solar wind in the whole model
domain between the Sun and the Earth to be improved, which will enable improved
forecasting of CME arrival time and speed.",2020-12-11T14:05:12Z
"Reliable stellar abundances of individual stars with the MUSE
  integral-field spectrograph","We present a novel approach to deriving stellar labels for stars observed in
MUSE fields making use of data-driven machine learning methods. Taking
advantage of the comparable spectral properties (resolution, wavelength
coverage) of the LAMOST and MUSE instruments, we adopt the Data-Driven Payne
(DD-Payne) model used on LAMOST observations and apply it to stars observed in
MUSE fields. Remarkably, in spite of instrumental differences, according to the
cross-validation of 27 LAMOST-MUSE common stars, we are able to determine
stellar labels with precision better than 75K in $T_{\rm eff}$, 0.15 dex in
$\log g$, and 0.1 dex in abundances of [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ti/Fe],
[C/Fe], [Ni/Fe] and [Cr/Fe] for current MUSE observations over a parameter
range of 3800<$T_{\rm eff}$<7000 K, -1.5<[Fe/H]<0.5 dex. To date, MUSE has been
used to target 13,000 fields across the southern sky since it was first
commissioned six years ago and it is unique in its ability to study dense star
fields such as globular clusters or the Milky Way bulge. Our method will enable
the automated determination of stellar parameters for all stars in these
fields. Additionally, it opens the door for applications to data collected by
other spectrographs having resolution similar to LAMOST. With the upcoming
BlueMUSE and MAVIS, we will gain access to a whole new range of chemical
abundances with higher precision, especially critical s-process elements such
as [Y/Fe] and [Ba/Fe] that provide key age diagnostics for stellar targets.",2021-09-20T07:11:00Z
Accelerating non-LTE synthesis and inversions with graph networks,"The computational cost of fast non-LTE synthesis is one of the challenges
that limits the development of 2D and 3D inversion codes. It also makes the
interpretation of observations of lines formed in the chromosphere and
transition region a slow and computationally costly process, which limits the
inference of the physical properties on rather small fields of view. Having
access to a fast way of computing the deviation from the LTE regime through the
departure coefficients could largely alleviate this problem. We propose to
build and train a graph network that quickly predicts the atomic level
populations without solving the non-LTE problem. We find an optimal
architecture for the graph network for predicting the departure coefficients of
the levels of an atom from the physical conditions of a model atmosphere. A
suitable dataset with a representative sample of potential model atmospheres is
used for training. This dataset has been computed using existing non-LTE
synthesis codes. The graph network has been integrated into existing synthesis
and inversion codes for the particular case of \caii. We demonstrate orders of
magnitude gain in computing speed. We analyze the generalization capabilities
of the graph network and demonstrate that it produces good predicted departure
coefficients for unseen models. We implement this approach in \hazel\ and show
how the inversions nicely compare with those obtained with standard non-LTE
inversion codes. Our approximate method opens up the possibility of extracting
physical information from the chromosphere on large fields-of-view with time
evolution.",2021-11-20T09:46:16Z
"PGNets: Planet mass prediction using convolutional neural networks for
  radio continuum observations of protoplanetary disks","We developed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to rapidly and directly
infer the planet mass from radio dust continuum images. Substructures induced
by young planets in protoplanetary disks can be used to infer the potential
young planets' properties. Hydrodynamical simulations have been used to study
the relationships between the planet's properties and these disk features.
However, these attempts either fine-tuned numerical simulations to fit one
protoplanetary disk at a time, which was time-consuming, or azimuthally
averaged simulation results to derive some linear relationships between the gap
width/depth and the planet mass, which lost information on asymmetric features
in disks. To cope with these disadvantages, we developed Planet Gap neural
Networks (PGNets) to infer the planet mass from 2D images. We first fit the
gridded data in Zhang et al. (2018) as a classification problem. Then, we
quadrupled the data set by running additional simulations with near-randomly
sampled parameters, and derived the planet mass and disk viscosity together as
a regression problem. The classification approach can reach an accuracy of
92\%, whereas the regression approach can reach 1$\sigma$ as 0.16 dex for
planet mass and 0.23 dex for disk viscosity. We can reproduce the degeneracy
scaling $\alpha$ $\propto$ $M_p^3$ found in the linear fitting method, which
means that the CNN method can even be used to find degeneracy relationship. The
gradient-weighted class activation mapping effectively confirms that PGNets use
proper disk features to constrain the planet mass. We provide programs for
PGNets and the traditional fitting method from Zhang et al. (2018), and discuss
each method's advantages and disadvantages.",2021-11-30T08:12:08Z
"Gaia Data Release 3: Cross-match of Gaia sources with variable objects
  from the literature","Context. In the current ever increasing data volumes of astronomical surveys,
automated methods are essential. Objects of known classes from the literature
are necessary for training supervised machine learning algorithms, as well as
for verification/validation of their results. Aims.The primary goal of this
work is to provide a comprehensive data set of known variable objects from the
literature cross-matched with \textit{Gaia}~DR3 sources, including a large
number of both variability types and representatives, in order to cover as much
as possible sky regions and magnitude ranges relevant to each class. In
addition, non-variable objects from selected surveys are targeted to probe
their variability in \textit{Gaia} and possible use as standards. This data set
can be the base for a training set applicable in variability detection,
classification, and validation. MethodsA statistical method that employed both
astrometry (position and proper motion) and photometry (mean magnitude) was
applied to selected literature catalogues in order to identify the correct
counterparts of the known objects in the \textit{Gaia} data. The cross-match
strategy was adapted to the properties of each catalogue and the verification
of results excluded dubious matches. Results.Our catalogue gathers 7\,841\,723
\textit{Gaia} sources among which 1.2~million non-variable objects and
1.7~million galaxies, in addition to 4.9~million variable sources representing
over 100~variability (sub)types. Conclusions.This data set served the
requirements of \textit{Gaia}'s variability pipeline for its third data release
(DR3), from classifier training to result validation, and it is expected to be
a useful resource for the scientific community that is interested in the
analysis of variability in the \textit{Gaia} data and other surveys.",2022-07-05T10:43:54Z
"White dwarf Random Forest classification through Gaia spectral
  coefficients","The third data release of Gaia has provided approximately 220 million low
resolution spectra. Among these, about 100,000 correspond to white dwarfs. The
magnitude of this quantity of data precludes the possibility of performing
spectral analysis and type determination by human inspection. In order to
tackle this issue, we explore the possibility of utilising a machine learning
approach, based on a Random Forest algorithm. We aim to analyze the viability
of the Random Forest algorithm for the spectral classification of the white
dwarf population within 100 pc from the Sun, based on the Hermite coefficients
of Gaia spectra. We utilized the assigned spectral type from the Montreal White
Dwarf Database for training and testing our Random Forest algorithm. Once
validated, our algorithm model is applied to the rest of unclassified white
dwarfs within 100 pc. First, we started by classifying the two major spectral
type groups of white dwarfs: hydrogen-rich (DA) and hydrogen-deficient
(non-DA). Next, we explored the possibility of classifying the various spectral
subtypes, including in some cases the secondary spectral types. Our Random
Forest classification presented a very high recall (>80%) for DA and DB white
dwarfs, and a very high precision (>90%) for DB, DQ and DZ white dwarfs. As a
result we have assigned a spectral type to 9,446 previously unclassified white
dwarfs: 4,739 DAs, 76 DBs (60 of them DBAs), 4,437 DCs, 132 DZs and 62 DQs (9
of them DQpec). Despite the low resolution of Gaia spectra, the Random Forest
algorithm applied to the Gaia spectral coefficients proves to be a highly
valuable tool for spectral classification.",2023-08-14T11:39:55Z
"Virialized equation of state for warm and dense stellar plasmas in
  proto-neutron stars and Supernova matter","We present microscopic Molecular Dynamics simulations including the efficient
Ewald sum procedure to study warm and dense stellar plasmas consisting of
finite-size ion charges immerse in a relativistic neutralizing electron gas.
For densities typical of Supernova matter and crust in a proto-neutron star, we
select a representative single ion composition and obtain the virialized
equation of state (vEoS). We scrutinize the finite-size and screening
corrections to the Coulomb potential appearing in the virial coefficients $B_2,
B_3$ and $B_4$ as a function of temperature. In addition, we study the thermal
heat capacity at constant volume, $C_V$, and the generalized Mayer's relation
i.e. the difference $C_P-C_V$ with $C_P$ being the heat capacity at constant
pressure, obtaining clear features signaling the onset of the liquid-gas phase
transition. Our findings show that microscopic simulations reproduce the
discontinuity in $C_V$, whose value lies between that of idealized gas and
crystallized configurations. We study the pressure isotherms marking the
boundary of the metastable region before the gaseous transition takes place.
The resulting vEoS displays a behaviour where effective virial coefficients
include extra density dependence showing a generalized density-temperature
form. As an application we parametrize pressure as a function of density and
temperature under the form of an artificial neural network showing the
potential of machine learning for future regression analysis in more refined
multicomponent approaches. This is of interest to size the importance of these
corrections in the liquid-gas phase transition in warm and dense plasma phases
contributing to the cooling behaviour of early Supernova phases and
proto-neutron stars.",2023-12-25T19:20:38Z
"Search for Brown Dwarfs in IC 1396 with Subaru HSC: Interpreting the
  Impact of Environmental Factors on Sub-stellar Population","Young stellar clusters are predominantly the hub of star formation and hence,
ideal to perform comprehensive studies over the least explored sub-stellar
regime. Various unanswered questions like the mass distribution in brown dwarf
regime and the effect of diverse cluster environment on brown dwarf formation
efficiency still plague the scientific community. The nearby young cluster, IC
1396 with its feedback-driven environment, is ideal to conduct such study. In
this paper we adopt a multi-wavelength approach, using deep Subaru HSC, Gaia
DR3, Pan-STARRS, UKIDSS/2MASS photometry and machine learning techniques to
identify the cluster members complete down to $\sim$ 0.03 M$_{\odot}$ in the
central 22$^{\prime}$ area of IC 1396. We identify 458 cluster members
including 62 brown dwarfs which are used to determine mass distribution in the
region. We obtain a star-to-brown dwarf ratio of $\sim$ 6 for a stellar mass
range 0.03 -- 1 M$_{\odot}$ in the studied cluster. The brown dwarf fraction is
observed to increase across the cluster as radial distance from the central
OB-stars increases. This study also compiles 15 young stellar clusters to check
the variation of star-to-brown dwarf ratio relative to stellar density and UV
flux ranging within 4-2500 stars pc$^{-2}$ and 0.7-7.3 G$_{0}$ respectively.
The brown dwarf fraction is observed to increase with stellar density but the
results about the influence of incident UV flux are inconclusive within this
range. This is the deepest study of IC 1396 as of yet and it will pave the way
to understand various aspects of brown dwarfs using spectroscopic observations
in future.",2024-02-07T19:25:28Z
J-PLUS: Bayesian object classification with a strum of BANNJOS,"With its 12 optical filters, the Javalambre-Photometric Local Universe Survey
(J-PLUS) provides an unprecedented multicolor view of the local Universe. The
third data release (DR3) covers 3,192 deg$^2$ and contains 47.4 million
objects. However, the classification algorithms currently implemented in its
pipeline are deterministic and based solely on the sources morphology. Our goal
is classify the sources identified in the J-PLUS DR3 images into stars,
quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), and galaxies. For this task, we present BANNJOS,
a machine learning pipeline that uses Bayesian neural networks to provide the
probability distribution function (PDF) of the classification. BANNJOS is
trained on photometric, astrometric, and morphological data from J-PLUS DR3,
Gaia DR3, and CatWISE2020, using over 1.2 million objects with spectroscopic
classification from SDSS DR18, LAMOST DR9, DESI EDR, and Gaia DR3. Results are
validated using $1.4 10^5$ objects and cross-checked against theoretical model
predictions. BANNJOS outperforms all previous classifiers in terms of accuracy,
precision, and completeness across the entire magnitude range. It delivers over
95% accuracy for objects brighter than $r = 21.5$ mag, and ~90% accuracy for
those up to $r = 22$ mag, where J-PLUS completeness is < 25%. BANNJOS is also
the first object classifier to provide the full probability distribution
function (PDF) of the classification, enabling precise object selection for
high purity or completeness, and for identifying objects with complex features,
like active galactic nuclei with resolved host galaxies. BANNJOS has
effectively classified J-PLUS sources into around 20 million galaxies, 1
million QSOs, and 26 million stars, with full PDFs for each, which allow for
later refinement of the sample. The upcoming J-PAS survey, with its 56 color
bands, will further enhance BANNJOS's ability to detail each source's nature.",2024-04-25T12:29:04Z
Information content of JWST spectra of WASP-39b,"WASP-39b was observed using several different JWST instrument modes and the
spectra were published in a series of papers by the ERS team. The current study
examines the information content of these spectra measured using the different
instrument modes, focusing on the complexity of the temperature-pressure
profiles and number of chemical species warranted by the data. We examine if
H2O, CO, CO2, K, H2S, CH4, and SO2 are detected in each of the instrument
modes. Two Bayesian inference methods are used to perform atmospheric
retrievals: standard nested sampling and supervised machine learning of the
random forest (trained on a model grid). For nested sampling, Bayesian model
comparison is used as a guide to identify the set of models with the required
complexity to explain the data. Generally, non-isothermal transit chords are
needed to fit the transmission spectra of WASP-39b, although the complexity of
the Tp-profile required is mode-dependent. The minimal set of chemical species
needed to fit a spectrum is mode-dependent as well, and also depends on whether
grey or non-grey clouds are assumed. When a non-grey cloud model is used to fit
the G395H spectrum, it generates a spectral continuum that compensates for the
H2O opacity. The same compensation is absent when fitting the non-grey cloud
model to the PRISM spectrum (which has broader wavelength coverage), suggesting
that it is spurious. The interplay between the cloud spectral continuum and the
H2O opacity determines if SO2 is needed to fit either spectrum. The inferred
elemental abundances of carbon and oxygen and the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios
are all mode- and model-dependent, and should be interpreted with caution.
Bayesian model comparison does not always offer a clear path forward for
favouring specific retrieval models (e.g. grey versus non-grey clouds) and thus
for enabling unambiguous interpretations of exoplanet spectra.",2024-05-04T12:51:50Z
PRODIGE -- Planet-forming disks in Taurus with NOEMA,"We aim to constrain the gas density and temperature distributions as well as
gas masses in several T Tauri protoplanetary disks located in Taurus. We use
the 12CO, 13CO, and C18O (2-1) isotopologue emission observed at 0.9 with the
IRAM NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) as part of the MPG-IRAM
Observatory Program PRODIGE (PROtostars and DIsks: Global Evolution PIs: P.
Caselli & Th. Henning). Our sample consists of Class II disks with no evidence
of strong radial substructures. We use thesedata to constrain the thermal and
chemical structure of these disks through theoretical models for gas emission.
To fit the combined optically thick and thin CO line data in Fourier space, we
developed the DiskCheF code, which includes the parameterized disk physical
structure, machine-learning (ML) accelerated chemistry, and the RADMC-3D line
radiative transfer module. A key novelty of DiskCheF is the fast and feasible
ML-based chemistry trained on the extended grid of the disk physical-chemical
models precomputed with the ANDES2 code. This ML approach allows complex
chemical kinetics models to be included in a time-consuming disk fitting
without the need to run a chemical code. We present a novel approach to
incorporate chemistry into disk modeling without the need to explicitly
calculate a chemical network every time. Using this new disk modeling tool, we
successfully fit the 12CO, 13CO, and C18O (2-1) data from the CI, CY, DL, DM,
DN, and IQ Tau disks. The combination of optically thin and optically thick CO
lines allows us to simultaneously constrain the disk temperature and mass
distribution, and derive the CO-based gas masses. These values are in
reasonable agreement with the disk dust masses rescaled by a factor of 100 as
well as with other indirect gas measurements.",2024-06-24T10:07:39Z
"The first catalogue of candidate white dwarf-main sequence binaries in
  open star clusters: A new window into common envelope evolution","Close binary systems are the progenitors to both Type Ia supernovae and the
compact object mergers that can be detected via gravitational waves. To achieve
a binary with a small radial separation, it is believed that the system likely
undergoes common envelope (CE) evolution. Despite its importance, CE evolution
may be one of the largest uncertainties in binary evolution due to a
combination of computational challenges and a lack of observed benchmarks where
both the post-CE and pre-CE conditions are known. Identifying post-CE systems
in star clusters can partially circumvent this second issue by providing an
independent age constraint on the system. For the first time, we conduct a
systematic search for white dwarf (WD) and main-sequence (MS) binary systems in
299 Milky Way open star clusters. Coupling Gaia DR3 photometry and kinematics
with multi-band photometry from Pan-STARRS1 and 2MASS, we apply a machine
learning based approach and find 52 high-probability candidates in 38 open
clusters. For a subset of our systems, we present follow-up spectroscopy from
the Gemini and Lick Observatories and archival light curves from TESS,
Kepler/K2 and the Zwicky Transient Facility. Examples of M-dwarfs with hot
companions are spectroscopically observed, along with regular system
variability. While the kinematics of our candidates are consistent with their
host clusters, some systems have spatial positions offset relative to their
hosts, potentially indicative of natal kicks. Ultimately, this catalogue is a
first step to obtaining a set of observational benchmarks to better link
post-CE systems to their pre-CE progenitors.",2024-07-05T18:00:02Z
"Transferring spectroscopic stellar labels to 217 million Gaia DR3 XP
  stars with SHBoost","We explore the feasibility of using machine-learning regression as a method
of extracting basic stellar parameters and line-of-sight extinctions, given
spectro-photometric data. To this end, we build a stable gradient-boosted
random-forest regressor (xgboost), trained on spectroscopic data, capable of
producing output parameters with reliable uncertainties from Gaia DR3 data
(most notably the low-resolution XP spectra) without ground-based spectroscopic
observations. Using Shapley additive explanations, we are able to interpret how
the predictions for each star are influenced by each data feature. For the
training and testing of the network, we use high-quality parameters obtained
from the StarHorse code for a sample of around eight million stars observed by
major spectroscopic surveys (APOGEE, GALAH, LAMOST, RAVE, SEGUE, and GES),
complemented by curated samples of hot stars, very metal-poor stars, white
dwarfs, and hot sub-dwarfs. The training data cover the whole sky, all Galactic
components, and almost the full magnitude range of the Gaia DR3 XP sample of
more than 217 million objects that also have parallaxes. We achieve median
uncertainties (at $G\approx16$) of 0.20 mag in V-band extinction, 0.01 dex in
logarithmic effective temperature, 0.20 dex in surface gravity, 0.18 dex in
metallicity, and $12\%$ in mass (over the full Gaia DR3 XP sample, with
considerable variations in precision as a function of magnitude and stellar
type). We succeed in predicting competitive results based on Gaia DR3 XP
spectra compared to classical isochrone fitting methods we employed in earlier
work, especially for the parameters $A_V$, $T_{\rm eff}$, and metallicity.
Finally, we showcase some applications of this new catalogue (e.g. extinction
maps, metallicity trends in the Milky Way, extended maps of young massive
stars, metal-poor stars, and metal-rich stars). [abridged]",2024-07-09T15:44:49Z
"Automatic Detection of Occulted Hard X-ray Flares Using Deep-Learning
  Methods","We present a concept for a machine-learning classification of hard X-ray
(HXR) emissions from solar flares observed by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy
Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI), identifying flares that are either
occulted by the solar limb or located on the solar disk. Although HXR
observations of occulted flares are important for particle-acceleration
studies, HXR data analyses for past observations were time consuming and
required specialized expertise. Machine-learning techniques are promising for
this situation, and we constructed a sample model to demonstrate the concept
using a deep-learning technique. Input data to the model are HXR spectrograms
that are easily produced from RHESSI data. The model can detect occulted flares
without the need for image reconstruction nor for visual inspection by experts.
A technique of convolutional neural networks was used in this model by
regarding the input data as images. Our model achieved a classification
accuracy better than 90 %, and the ability for the application of the method to
either event screening or for an event alert for occulted flares was
successfully demonstrated.",2021-01-27T17:11:35Z
"Parameters for > 300 million Gaia stars: Bayesian inference vs. machine
  learning","The Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), published in June 2022, delivers a diverse set
of astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic measurements for more than a
billion stars. The wealth and complexity of the data makes traditional
approaches for estimating stellar parameters for the full Gaia dataset almost
prohibitive. We have explored different supervised learning methods for
extracting basic stellar parameters as well as distances and line-of-sight
extinctions, given spectro-photo-astrometric data (including also the new Gaia
XP spectra). For training we use an enhanced high-quality dataset compiled from
Gaia DR3 and ground-based spectroscopic survey data covering the whole sky and
all Galactic components. We show that even with a simple neural-network
architecture or tree-based algorithm (and in the absence of Gaia XP spectra),
we succeed in predicting competitive results (compared to Bayesian isochrone
fitting) down to faint magnitudes. We will present a new Gaia DR3
stellar-parameter catalogue obtained using the currently best-performing
machine-learning algorithm for tabular data, XGBoost, in the near future.",2023-02-14T12:04:41Z
MAGIC: Microlensing Analysis Guided by Intelligent Computation,"The modeling of binary microlensing light curves via the standard
sampling-based method can be challenging, because of the time-consuming
light-curve computation and the pathological likelihood landscape in the
high-dimensional parameter space. In this work, we present MAGIC, which is a
machine-learning framework to efficiently and accurately infer the microlensing
parameters of binary events with realistic data quality. In MAGIC, binary
microlensing parameters are divided into two groups and inferred separately
with different neural networks. The key feature of MAGIC is the introduction of
a neural controlled differential equation, which provides the capability to
handle light curves with irregular sampling and large data gaps. Based on
simulated light curves, we show that MAGIC can achieve fractional uncertainties
of a few percent on the binary mass ratio and separation. We also test MAGIC on
a real microlensing event. MAGIC is able to locate degenerate solutions even
when large data gaps are introduced. As irregular samplings are common in
astronomical surveys, our method also has implications for other studies that
involve time series.",2022-06-16T14:14:13Z
"Towards Coupling Full-disk and Active Region-based Flare Prediction for
  Operational Space Weather Forecasting","Solar flare prediction is a central problem in space weather forecasting and
has captivated the attention of a wide spectrum of researchers due to recent
advances in both remote sensing as well as machine learning and deep learning
approaches. The experimental findings based on both machine and deep learning
models reveal significant performance improvements for task specific datasets.
Along with building models, the practice of deploying such models to production
environments under operational settings is a more complex and often
time-consuming process which is often not addressed directly in research
settings. We present a set of new heuristic approaches to train and deploy an
operational solar flare prediction system for $\geq$M1.0-class flares with two
prediction modes: full-disk and active region-based. In full-disk mode,
predictions are performed on full-disk line-of-sight magnetograms using deep
learning models whereas in active region-based models, predictions are issued
for each active region individually using multivariate time series data
instances. The outputs from individual active region forecasts and full-disk
predictors are combined to a final full-disk prediction result with a
meta-model. We utilized an equal weighted average ensemble of two base
learners' flare probabilities as our baseline meta learner and improved the
capabilities of our two base learners by training a logistic regression model.
The major findings of this study are: (i) We successfully coupled two
heterogeneous flare prediction models trained with different datasets and model
architecture to predict a full-disk flare probability for next 24 hours, (ii)
Our proposed ensembling model, i.e., logistic regression, improves on the
predictive performance of two base learners and the baseline meta learner
measured in terms of two widely used metrics True Skill Statistic (TSS) and
Heidke Skill core (HSS), and (iii) Our result analysis suggests that the
logistic regression-based ensemble (Meta-FP) improves on the full-disk model
(base learner) by $\sim9\%$ in terms TSS and $\sim10\%$ in terms of HSS.
Similarly, it improves on the AR-based model (base learner) by $\sim17\%$ and
$\sim20\%$ in terms of TSS and HSS respectively. Finally, when compared to the
baseline meta model, it improves on TSS by $\sim10\%$ and HSS by $\sim15\%$.",2022-08-11T22:34:44Z
Meta learning of bounds on the Bayes classifier error,"Meta learning uses information from base learners (e.g. classifiers or
estimators) as well as information about the learning problem to improve upon
the performance of a single base learner. For example, the Bayes error rate of
a given feature space, if known, can be used to aid in choosing a classifier,
as well as in feature selection and model selection for the base classifiers
and the meta classifier. Recent work in the field of f-divergence functional
estimation has led to the development of simple and rapidly converging
estimators that can be used to estimate various bounds on the Bayes error. We
estimate multiple bounds on the Bayes error using an estimator that applies
meta learning to slowly converging plug-in estimators to obtain the parametric
convergence rate. We compare the estimated bounds empirically on simulated data
and then estimate the tighter bounds on features extracted from an image patch
analysis of sunspot continuum and magnetogram images.",2015-04-27T14:49:24Z
"Efficient labeling of solar flux evolution videos by a deep learning
  model","Machine learning (ML) is becoming a critical tool for interrogation of large
complex data. Labeling, defined as the process of adding meaningful
annotations, is a crucial step of supervised ML. However, labeling datasets is
time consuming. Here we show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained
on crudely labeled astronomical videos, can be leveraged to improve the quality
of data labeling and reduce the need for human intervention. We use videos of
the solar magnetic field, crudely labeled into two classes: emergence or
non-emergence of bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs), based on their first
detection on the solar disk. We train CNNs using crude labels, manually verify,
correct labeling vs. CNN disagreements, and repeat this process until
convergence. Traditionally, flux emergence labelling is done manually. We find
that a high-quality labeled dataset, derived through this iterative process,
reduces the necessary manual verification by 50%. Furthermore, by gradually
masking the videos and looking for maximum change in CNN inference, we locate
BMR emergence time without retraining the CNN. This demonstrates the
versatility of CNNs for simplifying the challenging task of labeling complex
dynamic events.",2023-08-29T02:05:40Z
"Deep Learning for Space Weather Prediction: Bridging the Gap between
  Heliophysics Data and Theory","Traditionally, data analysis and theory have been viewed as separate
disciplines, each feeding into fundamentally different types of models. Modern
deep learning technology is beginning to unify these two disciplines and will
produce a new class of predictively powerful space weather models that combine
the physical insights gained by data and theory. We call on NASA to invest in
the research and infrastructure necessary for the heliophysics' community to
take advantage of these advances.",2022-12-27T00:30:39Z
SCSS-Net: Solar Corona Structures Segmentation by Deep Learning,"Structures in the solar corona are the main drivers of space weather
processes that might directly or indirectly affect the Earth. Thanks to the
most recent space-based solar observatories, with capabilities to acquire
high-resolution images continuously, the structures in the solar corona can be
monitored over the years with a time resolution of minutes. For this purpose,
we have developed a method for automatic segmentation of solar corona
structures observed in EUV spectrum that is based on a deep learning approach
utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks. The available input datasets have been
examined together with our own dataset based on the manual annotation of the
target structures. Indeed, the input dataset is the main limitation of the
developed model's performance. Our \textit{SCSS-Net} model provides results for
coronal holes and active regions that could be compared with other generally
used methods for automatic segmentation. Even more, it provides a universal
procedure to identify structures in the solar corona with the help of the
transfer learning technique. The outputs of the model can be then used for
further statistical studies of connections between solar activity and the
influence of space weather on Earth.",2021-09-22T16:51:50Z
A Ubiquitous Unifying Degeneracy in Two-Body Microlensing Systems,"While gravitational microlensing by planetary systems provides unique vistas
on the properties of exoplanets, observations of a given 2-body microlensing
event can often be interpreted with multiple distinct physical configurations.
Such ambiguities are typically attributed to the close-wide and inner-outer
types of degeneracies that arise from transformation invariances and symmetries
of microlensing caustics. However, there remain unexplained inconsistencies
between aforementioned theories and observations. Here, leveraging a fast
machine learning inference framework, we present the discovery of the offset
degeneracy, which concerns a magnification-matching behaviour on the lens-axis
and is formulated independent of caustics. This offset degeneracy unifies the
close-wide and inner-outer degeneracies, generalises to resonant topologies,
and upon reanalysis, not only appears ubiquitous in previously published
planetary events with 2-fold degenerate solutions, but also resolves prior
inconsistencies. Our analysis demonstrates that degenerate caustics do not
strictly result in degenerate magnifications and that the commonly invoked
close-wide degeneracy essentially never arises in actual events. Moreover, it
is shown that parameters in offset degenerate configurations are related by a
simple expression. This suggests the existence of a deeper symmetry in the
equations governing 2-body lenses than previously recognised.",2021-11-26T19:00:00Z
"The ILIUM forward modelling algorithm for multivariate parameter
  estimation and its application to derive stellar parameters from Gaia
  spectrophotometry","I introduce an algorithm for estimating parameters from multidimensional data
based on forward modelling. In contrast to many machine learning approaches it
avoids fitting an inverse model and the problems associated with this. The
algorithm makes explicit use of the sensitivities of the data to the
parameters, with the goal of better treating parameters which only have a weak
impact on the data. The forward modelling approach provides uncertainty (full
covariance) estimates in the predicted parameters as well as a goodness-of-fit
for observations. I demonstrate the algorithm, ILIUM, with the estimation of
stellar astrophysical parameters (APs) from simulations of the low resolution
spectrophotometry to be obtained by Gaia. The AP accuracy is competitive with
that obtained by a support vector machine. For example, for zero extinction
stars covering a wide range of metallicity, surface gravity and temperature,
ILIUM can estimate Teff to an accuracy of 0.3% at G=15 and to 4% for (lower
signal-to-noise ratio) spectra at G=20. [Fe/H] and logg can be estimated to
accuracies of 0.1-0.4dex for stars with G<=18.5. If extinction varies a priori
over a wide range (Av=0-10mag), then Teff and Av can be estimated quite
accurately (3-4% and 0.1-0.2mag respectively at G=15), but there is a strong
and ubiquitous degeneracy in these parameters which limits our ability to
estimate either accurately at faint magnitudes. Using the forward model we can
map these degeneracies (in advance), and thus provide a complete probability
distribution over solutions. (Abridged)",2009-11-27T11:28:04Z
"Cycle-StarNet: Bridging the gap between theory and data by leveraging
  large datasets","The advancements in stellar spectroscopy data acquisition have made it
necessary to accomplish similar improvements in efficient data analysis
techniques. Current automated methods for analyzing spectra are either (a)
data-driven, which requires prior knowledge of stellar parameters and elemental
abundances, or (b) based on theoretical synthetic models that are susceptible
to the gap between theory and practice. In this study, we present a hybrid
generative domain adaptation method that turns simulated stellar spectra into
realistic spectra by applying unsupervised learning to large spectroscopic
surveys. We apply our technique to the APOGEE H-band spectra at R=22,500 and
the Kurucz synthetic models. As a proof of concept, two case studies are
presented. The first of which is the calibration of synthetic data to become
consistent with observations. To accomplish this, synthetic models are morphed
into spectra that resemble observations, thereby reducing the gap between
theory and observations. Fitting the observed spectra shows an improved average
reduced $\chi_R^2$ from 1.97 to 1.22, along with a reduced mean residual from
0.16 to -0.01 in normalized flux. The second case study is the identification
of the elemental source of missing spectral lines in the synthetic modelling. A
mock dataset is used to show that absorption lines can be recovered when they
are absent in one of the domains. This method can be applied to other fields,
which use large data sets and are currently limited by modelling accuracy. The
code used in this study is made publicly available on github.",2020-07-06T23:06:58Z
Identifying Flux Rope Signatures Using a Deep Neural Network,"Among the current challenges in Space Weather, one of the main ones is to
forecast the internal magnetic configuration within Interplanetary Coronal Mass
Ejections (ICMEs). Currently, a monotonic and coherent magnetic configuration
observed is associated with the result of a spacecraft crossing a large flux
rope with helical magnetic field lines topology. The classification of such an
arrangement is essential to predict geomagnetic disturbance. Thus, the
classification relies on the assumption that the ICME's internal structure is a
well organized magnetic flux rope. This paper applies machine learning and a
current physical flux rope analytical model to identify and further understand
the internal structures of ICMEs. We trained an image recognition artificial
neural network with analytical flux rope data, generated from the range of many
possible trajectories within a cylindrical (circular and elliptical
cross-section) model. The trained network was then evaluated against the
observed ICMEs from WIND during 1995-2015.
  The methodology developed in this paper can classify 84% of simple real cases
correctly and has a 76% success rate when extended to a broader set with 5%
noise applied, although it does exhibit a bias in favor of positive flux rope
classification. As a first step towards a generalizable classification and
parameterization tool, these results show promise. With further tuning and
refinement, our model presents a strong potential to evolve into a robust tool
for identifying flux rope configurations from in situ data.",2020-08-30T23:23:57Z
"Multi-Channel Auto-Calibration for the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
  using Machine Learning","Solar activity plays a quintessential role in influencing the interplanetary
medium and space-weather around the Earth. Remote sensing instruments onboard
heliophysics space missions provide a pool of information about the Sun's
activity via the measurement of its magnetic field and the emission of light
from the multi-layered, multi-thermal, and dynamic solar atmosphere. Extreme UV
(EUV) wavelength observations from space help in understanding the subtleties
of the outer layers of the Sun, namely the chromosphere and the corona.
Unfortunately, such instruments, like the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
onboard NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), suffer from time-dependent
degradation, reducing their sensitivity. Current state-of-the-art calibration
techniques rely on periodic sounding rockets, which can be infrequent and
rather unfeasible for deep-space missions. We present an alternative
calibration approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We use
SDO-AIA data for our analysis. Our results show that CNN-based models could
comprehensively reproduce the sounding rocket experiments' outcomes within a
reasonable degree of accuracy, indicating that it performs equally well
compared with the current techniques. Furthermore, a comparison with a standard
""astronomer's technique"" baseline model reveals that the CNN approach
significantly outperforms this baseline. Our approach establishes the framework
for a novel technique to calibrate EUV instruments and advance our
understanding of the cross-channel relation between different EUV channels.",2020-12-27T22:43:37Z
Searching for Anomalies in the ZTF Catalog of Periodic Variable Stars,"Periodic variables illuminate the physical processes of stars throughout
their lifetime. Wide-field surveys continue to increase our discovery rates of
periodic variable stars. Automated approaches are essential to identify
interesting periodic variable stars for multi-wavelength and spectroscopic
follow-up. Here, we present a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to
hunt for anomalous periodic variables using phase-folded light curves presented
in the Zwicky Transient Facility Catalogue of Periodic Variable Stars by
\citet{Chen_2020}. We use a convolutional variational autoencoder to learn a
low dimensional latent representation, and we search for anomalies within this
latent dimension via an isolation forest. We identify anomalies with irregular
variability. Most of the top anomalies are likely highly variable Red Giants or
Asymptotic Giant Branch stars concentrated in the Milky Way galactic disk; a
fraction of the identified anomalies are more consistent with Young Stellar
Objects. Detailed spectroscopic follow-up observations are encouraged to reveal
the nature of these anomalies.",2021-12-06T19:01:19Z
"Automating Inference of Binary Microlensing Events with Neural Density
  Estimation","Automated inference of binary microlensing events with traditional
sampling-based algorithms such as MCMC has been hampered by the slowness of the
physical forward model and the pathological likelihood surface. Current
analysis of such events requires both expert knowledge and large-scale grid
searches to locate the approximate solution as a prerequisite to MCMC posterior
sampling. As the next generation, space-based microlensing survey with the
Roman Space Observatory is expected to yield thousands of binary microlensing
events, a new scalable and automated approach is desired. Here, we present an
automated inference method based on neural density estimation (NDE). We show
that the NDE trained on simulated Roman data not only produces fast, accurate,
and precise posteriors but also captures expected posterior degeneracies. A
hybrid NDE-MCMC framework can further be applied to produce the exact
posterior.",2020-10-08T17:58:06Z
Karhunen-Loève Data Imputation in High Contrast Imaging,"Detection and characterization of extended structures is a crucial goal in
high contrast imaging. However, these structures face challenges in data
reduction, leading to over-subtraction from speckles and self-subtraction with
most existing methods. Iterative post-processing methods offer promising
results, but their integration into existing pipelines is hindered by selective
algorithms, high computational cost, and algorithmic regularization. To address
this for reference differential imaging (RDI), here we propose the data
imputation concept to Karhunen-Lo\`eve transform (DIKL) by modifying two steps
in the standard Karhunen-Lo\`eve image projection (KLIP) method. Specifically,
we partition an image to two matrices: an anchor matrix which focuses only on
the speckles to obtain the DIKL coefficients, and a boat matrix which focuses
on the regions of astrophysical interest for speckle removal using DIKL
components. As an analytical approach, DIKL achieves high-quality results with
significantly reduced computational cost (~3 orders of magnitude less than
iterative methods). Being a derivative method of KLIP, DIKL is seamlessly
integrable into high contrast imaging pipelines for RDI observations.",2023-08-31T17:59:59Z
"Prediction of solar wind speed by applying convolutional neural network
  to potential field source surface (PFSS) magnetograms","An accurate solar wind speed model is important for space weather
predictions, catastrophic event warnings, and other issues concerning solar
wind - magnetosphere interaction. In this work, we construct a model based on
convolutional neural network (CNN) and Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS)
magnetograms, considering a solar wind source surface of $R_{\rm
SS}=2.5R_\odot$, aiming to predict the solar wind speed at the Lagrange 1 (L1)
point of the Sun-Earth system. The input of our model consists of four
Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) magnetograms at $R_{\rm SS}$, which are
7, 6, 5, and 4 days before the target epoch. Reduced magnetograms are used to
promote the model's efficiency. We use the Global Oscillation Network Group
(GONG) photospheric magnetograms and the potential field extrapolation model to
generate PFSS magnetograms at the source surface. The model provides
predictions of the continuous test dataset with an averaged correlation
coefficient (CC) of 0.52 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 80.8 km/s in an
eight-fold validation training scheme with the time resolution of the data as
small as one hour. The model also has the potential to forecast high speed
streams of the solar wind, which can be quantified with a general threat score
of 0.39.",2023-04-03T06:54:22Z
"GRINN: A Physics-Informed Neural Network for solving hydrodynamic
  systems in the presence of self-gravity","Modeling self-gravitating gas flows is essential to answering many
fundamental questions in astrophysics. This spans many topics including
planet-forming disks, star-forming clouds, galaxy formation, and the
development of large-scale structures in the Universe. However, the nonlinear
interaction between gravity and fluid dynamics offers a formidable challenge to
solving the resulting time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) in
three dimensions (3D). By leveraging the universal approximation capabilities
of a neural network within a mesh-free framework, physics informed neural
networks (PINNs) offer a new way of addressing this challenge. We introduce the
gravity-informed neural network (GRINN), a PINN-based code, to simulate 3D
self-gravitating hydrodynamic systems. Here, we specifically study
gravitational instability and wave propagation in an isothermal gas. Our
results match a linear analytic solution to within 1\% in the linear regime and
a conventional grid code solution to within 5\% as the disturbance grows into
the nonlinear regime. We find that the computation time of the GRINN does not
scale with the number of dimensions. This is in contrast to the scaling of the
grid-based code for the hydrodynamic and self-gravity calculations as the
number of dimensions is increased. Our results show that the GRINN computation
time is longer than the grid code in one- and two- dimensional calculations but
is an order of magnitude lesser than the grid code in 3D with similar accuracy.
Physics-informed neural networks like GRINN thus show promise for advancing our
ability to model 3D astrophysical flows.",2023-08-15T19:50:07Z
"Weighing Milky Way and Andromeda in an Expanding $Λ$CDM Universe:
  Resolving the Local Group mass tension","The dynamics of the Local Group (LG), especially the contribution of the
Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) galaxies, is sensitive to the presence of
dark energy. This work compares the evolution of the LG by considering it as a
two-body problem in a homogeneous and isotropic expanding spacetime in a full
$\Lambda$CDM background. Using the Timing Argument (which links LG dynamics to
LG mass) we find that the full $\Lambda$CDM background predicts a $\sim 10 \%$
lower mass for the LG while $\Lambda$ alone predicts a $\sim 10 \%$ higher
mass. By the calibration of the IllustrisTNG simulations, the TA mass is shown
to be biased high, and modified to be $\left(3.89 \pm 0.62\right) \cdot 10^{12}
M_{\odot}$. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the MW Center Of Mass (COM)
reduce the LG mass to be $\left(2.33 \pm 0.72\right) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$.
The overall estimated mass is compatible with the total sum of masses of MW and
M31 (including their halos) estimated independently. The mass also is
compatible with other estimations such as the Hubble flow, the Virial Theorem
with the other dwarf galaxies and different Machine Learning methods based on
LG-like pairs from simulations. These results resolve the controversy between
the TA based estimations and the other probes in the literature.",2024-01-17T19:02:51Z
"Short-Period Variables in TESS Full-Frame Image Light Curves Identified
  via Convolutional Neural Networks","The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission measured light from
stars in ~85% of the sky throughout its two-year primary mission, resulting in
millions of TESS 30-minute cadence light curves to analyze in the search for
transiting exoplanets. To search this vast dataset, we aim to provide an
approach that is both computationally efficient, produces highly performant
predictions, and minimizes the required human search effort. We present a
convolutional neural network that we train to identify short period variables.
To make a prediction for a given light curve, our network requires no prior
target parameters identified using other methods. Our network performs
inference on a TESS 30-minute cadence light curve in ~5ms on a single GPU,
enabling large scale archival searches. We present a collection of 14156
short-period variables identified by our network. The majority of our
identified variables fall into two prominent populations, one of short-period
main sequence binaries and another of Delta Scuti stars. Our neural network
model and related code is additionally provided as open-source code for public
use and extension.",2024-02-19T18:56:35Z
"Automatic Detection of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections in Solar
  Wind In Situ Data","Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are one of the main drivers for
space weather disturbances. In the past, different approaches have been used to
automatically detect events in existing time series resulting from solar wind
in situ observations. However, accurate and fast detection still remains a
challenge when facing the large amount of data from different instruments. For
the automatic detection of ICMEs we propose a pipeline using a method that has
recently proven successful in medical image segmentation. Comparing it to an
existing method, we find that while achieving similar results, our model
outperforms the baseline regarding training time by a factor of approximately
20, thus making it more applicable for other datasets. The method has been
tested on in situ data from the Wind spacecraft between 1997 and 2015 with a
True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.64. Out of the 640 ICMEs, 466 were detected
correctly by our algorithm, producing a total of 254 False Positives.
Additionally, it produced reasonable results on datasets with fewer features
and smaller training sets from Wind, STEREO-A and STEREO-B with True Skill
Statistics of 0.56, 0.57 and 0.53, respectively. Our pipeline manages to find
the start of an ICME with a mean absolute error (MAE) of around 2 hours and 56
minutes, and the end time with a MAE of 3 hours and 20 minutes. The relatively
fast training allows straightforward tuning of hyperparameters and could
therefore easily be used to detect other structures and phenomena in solar wind
data, such as corotating interaction regions.",2022-05-07T07:25:05Z

Three editions of the Star Catalogue of Tycho Brahe,"Tycho Brahe completed his catalogue with the positions and magnitudes of 1004
fixed stars in 1598. This catalogue circulated in manuscript form. Brahe edited
a shorter version with 777 stars, printed in 1602, and Kepler edited the full
catalogue of 1004 stars, printed in 1627. We provide machine-readable versions
of the three versions of the catalogue, describe the differences between them
and briefly discuss their accuracy on the basis of comparison with modern data
from the Hipparcos Catalogue. We also compare our results with earlier analyses
by Dreyer (1916) and Rawlins (1993), finding good overall agreement. The
magnitudes given by Brahe correlate well with modern values, his longitudes and
latitudes have error distributions with widths of about 2 arcmin, with excess
numbers of stars with larger errors (as compared to Gaussian distributions), in
particular for the faintest stars. Errors in positions larger than 10 arcmin,
which comprise about 15 per cent of the entries, are likely due to computing or
copying errors.",2010-03-19T16:39:01Z
Context-Aware Neural Video Compression on Solar Dynamics Observatory,"NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission collects large data volumes
of the Sun's daily activity. Data compression is crucial for space missions to
reduce data storage and video bandwidth requirements by eliminating
redundancies in the data. In this paper, we present a novel neural
Transformer-based video compression approach specifically designed for the SDO
images. Our primary objective is to efficiently exploit the temporal and
spatial redundancies inherent in solar images to obtain a high compression
ratio. Our proposed architecture benefits from a novel Transformer block called
Fused Local-aware Window (FLaWin), which incorporates window-based
self-attention modules and an efficient fused local-aware feed-forward (FLaFF)
network. This architectural design allows us to simultaneously capture
short-range and long-range information while facilitating the extraction of
rich and diverse contextual representations. Moreover, this design choice
results in reduced computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate
the significant contribution of the FLaWin Transformer block to the compression
performance, outperforming conventional hand-engineered video codecs such as
H.264 and H.265 in terms of rate-distortion trade-off.",2023-09-19T17:33:12Z
"High-Performance Distributed Multi-Model / Multi-Kernel Simulations: A
  Case-Study in Jungle Computing","High-performance scientific applications require more and more compute power.
The concurrent use of multiple distributed compute resources is vital for
making scientific progress. The resulting distributed system, a so-called
Jungle Computing System, is both highly heterogeneous and hierarchical,

An all-sky Support Vector Machine selection of WISE YSO Candidates,"We explored the AllWISE catalogue of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
mission and identified Young Stellar Object candidates. Reliable 2MASS and WISE
photometric data combined with Planck dust opacity values were used to build
our dataset and to find the best classification scheme. A sophisticated
statistical method, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to analyse the
multi-dimensional data space and to remove source types identified as
contaminants (extragalactic sources, main sequence stars, evolved stars and
sources related to the interstellar medium). Objects listed in the SIMBAD
database are used to identify the already known sources and to train our
method. A new all-sky selection of 133,980 Class I/II YSO candidates is
presented. The estimated contamination was found to be well below 1% based on
comparison with our SIMBAD training set. We also compare our results to that of
existing methods and catalogues. The SVM selection process successfully
identified >90% of the Class I/II YSOs based on comparison with photometric and
spectroscopic YSO catalogues. Our conclusion is that by using the SVM, our
classification is able to identify more known YSOs of the training sample than
other methods based on colour-colour and magnitude-colour selection. The
distribution of the YSO candidates well correlates with that of the Planck

"A Study of the Evolution of the Close Binaries Cyg X-3, IC 10 X-1, NGC

SS 433, and M33 X-7 are computed using the Scenario Machine code. The compact
objects in IC 10 X-1, NGC 300 X-1, and M33 X-7 are the most massive stellar
mass black hole candidates. Cyg X-3, IC 10 X-1, and NGC 300 X-1 are the only
currently known Wolf-Rayet stars with degenerate companions. SS 433 is the only
known superaccretor in the Milky Way. Therefore, the stars studied provide
excellent laboratories for testing scenarios for the evolution of binaries
under extreme conditions. The classical evolutionary scenario is consistent
with modern observational data. During the evolution of these binaries,
hypernova explosions accompanied by the collapse of stellar cores with large
angular momenta can occur, leading to long gamma-ray bursts. At the end of
their evolution, Cyg X-3, IC 10 X-1, NGC 300 X-1, and SS 433 may form binary
relativistic objects, which will subsequently merge due to the radiation of
gravitational waves. The gravitational waves emitted during mergers of
relativistic stars should be detectable by existing and future
gravitational-wave antennas. In the course of its future evolution, M33 X-7

Automatic Detection of Limb Prominences in 304 A EUV Images,"A new algorithm for automatic detection of prominences on the solar limb in
304 A EUV images is presented, and results of its application to SOHO/EIT data
discussed. The detection is based on the method of moments combined with a
classifier analysis aimed at discriminating between limb prominences, active
regions, and the quiet corona. This classifier analysis is based on a Support
Vector Machine (SVM). Using a set of 12 moments of the radial intensity
profiles, the algorithm performs well in discriminating between the above three
categories of limb structures, with a misclassification rate of 7%. Pixels
detected as belonging to a prominence are then used as starting point to
reconstruct the whole prominence by morphological image processing techniques.
It is planned that a catalogue of limb prominences identified in SOHO and

a Gaussian distribution. The position accuracy decreases slowly with magnitude.
The fraction of stars with position errors larger than a degree is 1.5 per
cent, rather smaller than the fraction of 5 per cent in the star catalogue of
Brahe.",2010-03-19T16:57:48Z
"Stellar Rotation Periods of the Kepler Objects of Interest: A Dearth of
  Close-in Planets around Fast Rotators","We present a large sample of stellar rotation periods for Kepler Objects of
Interest (KOIs), based on three years of public Kepler data. These were
measured by detecting periodic photometric modulation caused by star spots,
using an algorithm based on the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the light
curve, developed recently by McQuillan, Aigrain & Mazeh (2013). Of the 1919
main-sequence exoplanet hosts analyzed, robust rotation periods were detected
for 737. Comparing the detected stellar periods to the orbital periods of the
innermost planet in each system reveals a notable lack of close-in planets
around rapid rotators. It appears that only slowly spinning stars, with
rotation periods longer than 5-10 days, host planets on orbits shorter than 3
days, although the mechanism(s) that lead(s) to this is not clear.",2013-08-08T13:28:51Z
"Rotation Periods, Variability Properties and Ages for Kepler Exoplanet
  Candidate Host Stars","We report rotation periods, variability characteristics, gyrochronological
ages for ~950 of the Kepler Object of Interest host stars. We find a wide
dispersion in the amplitude of the photometric variability as a function of
rotation, likely indicating differences in the spot distribution among stars.
We use these rotation periods in combination with published spectroscopic
measurements of vsini and stellar parameters to derive the stellar inclination
in the line-of-sight, and find a number of systems with possible spin-orbit
misalignment. We additionally find several systems with close-in planet
candidates whose stellar rotation periods are equal to or twice the planetary
orbital period, indicative of possible tidal interactions between these planets
and their parent stars. If these systems survive validation to become confirmed
planets, they will provide important clues to the evolutionary history of these
systems.",2013-09-09T13:53:08Z
Man Versus Machine: Eye Estimates in the Age of Digital Imaging,"Astronomical observing has been greatly simplified by the development and
implementation of digital imaging techniques and remote observing. Aperture
photometry of CCD data permits photometric measurements to be made routinely
with uncertainties of a few hundredths of a magnitude or better. The question
of whether there is still a place in modern observational astronomy for simple
eye estimates of brightness is considered. Examples of recent uses of eye
estimates are presented. Suggestions for when eye estimates should be avoided
and when they are still worthwhile are offered. The reactions to these
suggestions by the conference audience are summarized.",2013-10-02T01:23:28Z
The Dynamic Infrared Sky,"Opening up the dynamic infrared sky for systematic time-domain exploration
would yield many scientific advances. Multi-messenger pursuits such as
localizing gravitational waves from neutron star mergers and quantifying the
nucleosynthetic yields require the infrared. Another multi-messenger endeavor
that needs infrared surveyors is the study of the much-awaited supernova in our
own Milky Way. Understanding shocks in novae, true rates of supernovae and
stellar mergers are some other examples of stellar evolution and high energy
physics wherein the answers are buried in the infrared. We discuss some of the
challenges in the infrared and pathfinders to overcome them. We conclude with
recommendations on both infrared discovery engines and infrared follow-up
machines that would enable this field to flourish in the next decade.",2019-03-19T17:38:25Z
"Coadded Spectroscopic Stellar Parameters and Abundances from the LAMOST
  Low Resolution Survey","I combine duplicate spectroscopic stellar parameter estimates in the Large
Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) Data Release 6 Low
Resolution Spectral Survey A, F, G, and K Type stellar parameter catalog.
Combining repeat measurements results in a factor of two improvement in the
precision of the spectroscopic stellar parameter estimates. Moreover, this
trivializes the process of performing coordinate-based cross-matching with
other catalogs. Similarly, I combine duplicate stellar abundance estimates for
the Xiang et al. catalog which was produced using LAMOST Data Release 5 Low
Resolution Spectral Survey data. These data have numerous applications in
stellar, galactic, and exoplanet astronomy. The catalogs I produce are
available as machine-readable tables at https://doi.org/10.7281/T1/QISGRU .",2021-02-08T19:00:00Z
"New rotation period measurements for M dwarfs in the southern
  hemisphere: an abundance of slowly rotating, fully convective stars","Stellar rotation periods are valuable both for constraining models of angular
momentum loss and for under- standing how magnetic features impact inferences
of exoplanet parameters. Building on our previous work in the northern
hemisphere, we have used long-term, ground-based photometric monitoring from
the MEarth Observatory to measure 234 rotation periods for nearby, southern
hemisphere M dwarfs. Notable examples include the exoplanet hosts GJ 1132, LHS
1140, and Proxima Centauri. We find excellent agreement between our data and K2
photometry for the overlapping subset. Amongst the sample of stars with the
highest quality datasets, we recover periods in 66%; as the length of the
dataset increases, our recovery rate approaches 100%. The longest rotation
periods we detect are around 140 days, which we suggest represent the periods
that are reached when M dwarfs are as old as the local thick disk (about 9
Gyr).",2018-07-24T21:35:34Z
Accuracy and precision of industrial stellar abundances,"There has been an incredibly large investment in obtaining high-resolution
stellar spectra for determining chemical abundances of stars. This information
is crucial to answer fundamental questions in Astronomy by constraining the
formation and evolution scenarios of the Milky Way as well as the stars and
planets residing in it.
  We have just entered a new era, in which chemical abundances of FGK-type
stars are being produced at industrial scales, where the observations,
reduction, and analysis of the data are automatically performed by machines.
Here we review the latest human efforts to assess the accuracy and precision of
such industrial abundances by providing insights in the steps and uncertainties
associated with the process of determining stellar abundances.
  To do so, we highlight key issues in the process of spectral analysis for
abundance determination, with special effort in disentangling sources of
uncertainties. We also provide a description of current and forthcoming
spectroscopic surveys, focusing on their reported abundances and uncertainties.
This allows us to identify which elements and spectral lines are best and why.
Finally, we make a brief selection of main scientific questions the community
is aiming to answer with abundances.",2018-11-20T01:30:36Z
A Gaia Survey for Young Stars Associated with the Lupus Clouds,"I have used high-precision photometry and astrometry from the second data
release of the Gaia mission to perform a survey for young stars associated with
the Lupus clouds, which have distances of ~160 pc and reside within the Sco-Cen
OB association. The Gaia data have made it possible to distinguish Lupus
members from most of the stars in other groups in Sco-Cen that overlap with the
Lupus clouds, which have contaminated previous surveys. The new catalog of
candidate Lupus members should be complete for spectral types earlier than M7
at A_K<0.2 within fields encompassing clouds 1--4. I have used that catalog to
characterize various aspects of the Lupus stellar population. For instance, the
sequence of low-mass stars in Lupus is ~0.4 mag brighter than the sequence for
Upper Sco, which implies an age of ~6 Myr based an adopted age of 10-12 Myr for
Upper Sco and the change in luminosity with age predicted by evolutionary
models. I also find that the initial mass function in Lupus is similar to that
in other nearby star-forming regions based on a comparison of their
distributions of spectral types.",2020-09-10T19:48:00Z
"Mid-Infrared Period$-$Luminosity Relations for Miras in the Large
  Magellanic Cloud","We present the mid-infrared (mid-IR) period$-$luminosity relations (PLRs)
using over 1000 Mira variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), for the
four Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the four Spitzer bands.
These PLRs cover a mid-IR wavelength range from $3.4$ $\mu$m to $22$ $\mu$m and
are presented separately for the oxygen-rich (O-rich) and carbon-rich (C-rich)
Miras. These relations can be used to measure distances to individual O-rich
and/or C-rich Mira stars with the accuracy of $5\%$ and $12\%$, respectively.
They are the most accurate Mira PLRs in the mid-IR to date.",2020-12-23T19:00:19Z
"Testing the empirical relationship between Forbush decreases and cosmic
  ray diurnal anisotropy","The abrupt aperiodic modulation of cosmic ray (CR) flux intensity, often
referred to as Forbush decrease (FD), plays a significant role in our
understanding of the Sun-Earth electrodynamics. Accurate and precise
determination of FD magnitude and timing are among the intractable problems in
FD-based analysis. FD identification is complicated by CR diurnal anisotropy.
CR anisotropy can increase or reduce the number and amplitude of FDs. It is
therefore important to remove its contributions from CR raw data before FD
identification. Recently, an attempt was made, using a combination of Fourier
transformed technique and FD-location machine to address this. Thus, two FD
catalogs and amplitude diurnal variation (ADV) were calculated from filtered
(FD1 and ADV) and raw (FD2) CR data. In the current work, we test the empirical
relationship between FD1, FD2, ADV, and solar-geophysical characteristics. Our
analysis shows that two types of magnetic fields-interplanetary (IMF) and
geomagnetic (Dst) govern the evolution of CR flux intensity reductions.",2022-03-16T18:56:32Z
"Mechanisms of Core-Collapse Supernovae & Simulation Results from the
  CHIMERA Code","Unraveling the mechanism for core-collapse supernova explosions is an
outstanding computational challenge and the problem remains essentially
unsolved despite more than four decades of effort. However, much progress in
realistic modeling has occurred recently through the availability of
multi-teraflop machines and the increasing sophistication of supernova codes.
These improvements have led to some key insights which may clarify the picture
in the not too distant future. Here we briefly review the current status of the
three explosion mechanisms (acoustic, MHD, and neutrino heating) that are
currently under active investigation, concentrating on the neutrino heating
mechanism as the one most likely responsible for producing explosions from
progenitors in the mass range ~10 to ~25 solar masses. We then briefly describe
the CHIMERA code, a supernova code we have developed to simulate core-collapse
supernovae in 1, 2, and 3 spatial dimensions. We finally describe the results
of an ongoing suite of 2D simulations initiated from a 12, 15, 20, and 25 solar
mass progenitor. These have all exhibited explosions and are currently in the
expanding phase with the shock at between 5,000 and 10,000 km. We finally very
briefly describe an ongoing simulation in 3 spatial dimensions initiated from
the 15 solar mass progenitor.",2010-02-26T01:31:26Z
Fast Optical and X-ray Variability in the UCXB 4U0614+09,"We present results from several years of fast optical photometry of
4U0614+091 (V1055 Orionis), a candidate ultracompact X-ray binary most likely
consisting of a neutron star and a degenerate secondary. We find evidence for
strong accretion-driven variability at all epochs, that manifests itself as red
noise. This flickering produces transient peaks in the observed power spectrum
in the 15-65 min period range. Only in one of our 12 optical datasets can we
see evidence for a period that cannot be reproduced using the red noise model.
This period of 51 minutes coincides with the strongest period detected by
Shahbaz et al. (2008) and can thus be taken as the prime candidate for the
orbital period of the system. Furthermore, we find some tentative evidence for
the X-ray vs. optical flux anticorrelation discovered by Machin et al. (1990)
using our data together with the all-sky X-ray monitoring data from RXTE/ASM.
We propose that the complex time series behaviour of 4U0614+09 is a result of
drastic changes in the accretion disc geometry/structure on time scales from
hours to days. Finally we want to draw attention to the interpretation of
moderately strong peaks in the power spectra of, especially accreting, sources.
Many of such ""periods"" can probably be attributed to the presence of red noise
(i.e. correlated events) in the data.",2011-05-16T11:52:00Z
"Improved Variable Star Search in Large Photometric Data Sets -- New
  Variables in CoRoT Field LRa02 Detected by BEST II","The CoRoT field LRa02 has been observed with the Berlin Exoplanet Search
Telescope II (BEST II) during the southern summer 2007/2008. A first analysis
of stellar variability led to the publication of 345 newly discovered variable
stars. Now, a deeper analysis of this data set was used to optimize the
variability search procedure. Several methods and parameters have been tested
in order to improve the selection process compared to the widely used J index
for variability ranking. This paper describes an empirical approach to treat
systematic trends in photometric data based upon the analysis of variance
statistics that can significantly decrease the rate of false detections.
  Finally, the process of reanalysis and method improvement has virtually
doubled the number of variable stars compared to the first analysis by Kabath
et al. A supplementary catalog of 272 previously unknown periodic variables
plus 52 stars with suspected variability is presented. Improved ephemerides are
given for 19 known variables in the field. In addition, the BEST II results are
compared with CoRoT data and its automatic variability classification.",2012-05-09T12:39:07Z
Detailed Abundances of Two Very Metal-Poor Stars in Dwarf Galaxies,"The most metal-poor stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) can show the
nucleosynthetic patterns of one or a few supernovae. These supernovae could
have zero metallicity, making metal-poor dSph stars the closest surviving links
to Population III stars. Metal-poor dSph stars also help to reveal the
formation mechanism of the Milky Way halo. We present the detailed abundances
from Keck/HIRES spectroscopy for two very metal-poor stars in two Milky Way
dSphs. One star, in the Sculptor dSph, has [Fe I/H] = -2.40. The other star, in
the Ursa Minor dSph, has [Fe I/H] = -3.16. Both stars fall in the previously
discovered low-metallicity, high-[alpha/Fe] plateau. Most abundance ratios of
very metal-poor stars in these two dSphs are largely consistent with very
metal-poor halo stars. However, the abundances of Na and some r-process
elements lie at the lower end of the envelope defined by inner halo stars of
similar metallicity. We propose that the metallicity dependence of supernova
yields is the cause. The earliest supernovae in low-mass dSphs have less gas to
pollute than the earliest supernovae in massive halo progenitors. As a result,
dSph stars at -3 < [Fe/H] < -2 sample supernovae with [Fe/H] << -3, whereas
halo stars in the same metallicity range sample supernovae with [Fe/H] ~ -3.
Consequently, enhancements in [Na/Fe] and [r/Fe] were deferred to higher
metallicity in dSphs than in the progenitors of the inner halo.",2012-09-17T20:00:14Z
"Detailed Abundance Analysis of the Brightest Star in Segue 2, the Least
  Massive Galaxy","We present the first high resolution spectroscopic observations of one red
giant star in the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Segue 2, which has the lowest total
mass (including dark matter) estimated for any known galaxy. These observations
were made using the MIKE spectrograph on the Magellan II Telescope at Las
Campanas Observatory. We perform a standard abundance analysis of this star,
SDSS J021933.13+200830.2, and present abundances of 21 species of 18 elements
as well as upper limits for 25 additional species. We derive [Fe/H] = -2.9, in
excellent agreement with previous estimates from medium resolution
spectroscopy. Our main result is that this star bears the chemical signatures
commonly found in field stars of similar metallicity. The heavy elements
produced by neutron-capture reactions are present, but they are deficient at
levels characteristic of stars in other ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and a few
luminous dwarf galaxies. The otherwise normal abundance patterns suggest that
the gas from which this star formed was enriched by metals from multiple Type
II supernovae reflecting a relatively well-sampled IMF. This adds to the
growing body of evidence indicating that Segue 2 may have been substantially
more massive in the past.",2014-03-11T20:06:03Z
"Improved V II log($gf$) Values, Hyperfine Structure Constants, and
  Abundance Determinations in the Photospheres of the Sun and Metal-poor Star
  HD 84937","New experimental absolute atomic transition probabilities are reported for
203 lines of V II. Branching fractions are measured from spectra recorded using
a Fourier transform spectrometer and an echelle spectrometer. The branching
fractions are normalized with radiative lifetime measurements to determine the
new transition probabilities. Generally good agreement is found between this
work and previously reported V II transition probabilities. Use of two
spectrometers, independent radiometric calibration methods, and independent
data analysis routines enables a reduction in systematic uncertainties, in
particular those due to optical depth errors. In addition, new hyperfine
structure constants are measured for selected levels by least squares fitting
line profiles in the FTS spectra. The new V II data are applied to high
resolution visible and UV spectra of the Sun and metal-poor star HD 84937 to
determine new, more accurate V abundances. Lines covering a range of wavelength
and excitation potential are used to search for non-LTE effects. Very good
agreement is found between our new solar photospheric V abundance, log
{\epsilon}(V) = 3.95 from 15 V II lines, and the solar-system meteoritic value.
In HD 84937, we derive [V/H] = -2.08 from 68 lines, leading to a value of
[V/Fe] = 0.24.",2014-08-18T23:05:25Z
Stellar Multiplicity and Debris Disks: An Unbiased Sample,"Circumstellar dust disks have been observed around many nearby stars.
However, many stars are part of binary or multiple stellar systems. A natural
question arises regarding the presence and properties of such disks in systems
with more than one star. To address this, we consider a sample of 449 systems
(spectral types A-M) observed with the Herschel Space Observatory as part of
the DEBRIS program. We have examined the stellar multiplicity of this sample by
gathering information from the literature and performing an adaptive optics
imaging survey at Lick Observatory. Five new companions were revealed with our
program. In total, we identify 188 (42%) binary or multiple star systems. The
multiplicity of the sample is examined with regards to the detection of
circumstellar disks for stars of spectral types AFGK.
  In general, disks are less commonly detected around binaries than single
stars, though the disk frequency is comparable among A stars regardless of
multiplicity. However, this sample reveals the period distribution of
disk-bearing binaries is consistent with that of non-disk binaries and with
comparison field samples. We find that the properties of disks in binary
systems are not statistically different from those around single stars.
Although the frequency of disk-bearing FGK binaries may be lower than in single
star systems, the processes behind disk formation and the characteristics of
these disks are comparable among both populations.",2015-03-04T14:47:54Z
"A Survey for New Members of the Taurus Star-Forming Region with the
  Sloan Digital Sky Survey","Previous studies have found that ~1 deg2 fields surrounding the stellar
aggregates in the Taurus star-forming region exhibit a surplus of solar-mass
stars relative to denser clusters like IC~348 and the Orion Nebula Cluster. To
test whether this difference reflects mass segregation in Taurus or a variation
in the IMF, we have performed a survey for members of Taurus across a large
field (~40 deg2) that was imaged by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We
obtained optical and near-infrared spectra of candidate members identified with
those images and the Two Micron All Sky Survey, as well as miscellaneous
candidates that were selected with several other diagnostics of membership. We
have classified 22 of the candidates as new members of Taurus, which includes
one of the coolest known members (M9.75). Our updated census of members within
the SDSS field shows a surplus of solar-mass stars relative to clusters,
although it is less pronounced than in the smaller fields towards the stellar
aggregates that were surveyed for previously measured mass functions in Taurus.
In addition to spectra of our new members, we include in our study near-IR
spectra of roughly half of the known members of Taurus, which are used to
refine their spectral types and extinctions. We also present an updated set of
near-IR standard spectra for classifying young stars and brown dwarfs at M and
L types.",2016-10-28T21:50:53Z
MAGNUS: A new resistive MHD code with heat flow terms,"We present a new magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code for the simulation of wave
propagation in the solar atmosphere, under the effects of electrical
resistivity, but not dominant, and heat transference in a uniform 3D grid. The
code is based on the finite volume method combined with the HLLE and HLLC
approximate Riemann solvers, which use different slope limiters like MINMOD,
MC, and WENO5. In order to control the growth of the divergence of the magnetic
field, due to numerical errors, we apply the Flux Constrained Transport method,
which is described in detail to understand how the resistive terms are included
in the algorithm. In our results, it is verified that this method preserves the
divergence of the magnetic fields within the machine round-off error. For the
validation of the accuracy and efficiency of the schemes implemented in the
code, we present some numerical tests in 1D and 2D for the ideal MHD. Later, we
show one test for the resistivity in a magnetic reconnection process and one
for the thermal conduction, where the temperature is advected by the magnetic
field lines. Moreover, we display two numerical problems associated with the
MHD wave propagation. The first one corresponds to a 3D evolution of a vertical
velocity pulse at the photosphere-transition-corona region, while the second
one consists in a 2D simulation of a transverse velocity pulse in a coronal
loop.",2017-06-15T22:53:25Z
"Spectral Properties of Cool Stars: Extended Abundance Analysis of Kepler
  Objects of Interest","Accurate stellar parameters and precise elemental abundances are vital pieces
to correctly characterize discovered planetary systems, better understand
planet formation, and trace galactic chemical evolution. We have performed a
uniform spectroscopic analysis for 1127 stars, yielding accurate gravity,
temperature, and projected rotational velocity in addition to precise
abundances for 15 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni,
and Y). Most of the stars in this sample are Kepler Objects of Interest,
observed by the California-Kepler Survey (CKS) and include 1,003 stars hosting
1,562 confirmed planets. This catalog extends the uniform analysis of our
previous catalog, bringing the total of homogeneously analyzed stars to almost
2,700 F, G, and K dwarfs. To ensure consistency between the catalogs, we
performed an analysis of our ability to recover parameters as a function of S/N
ratio and present individual uncertainties as well as functions to calculate
uncertainties for parameters derived from lower S/N ratio spectra. With the
updated parameters, we used isochrone fitting to derived new radii, masses and
ages for the stars. Finally, we look at the Mg/Si ratios of super-Earth and
sub-Neptune hosts to test whether differences in initial composition might lead
to differences in planet radius. We find no differences in the Mg/Si
distribution as a function of planet radius.",2018-04-02T18:00:36Z
Classifying Signatures of Sudden Ionospheric Disturbances,"Solar activity, such as flares, produce bursts of high-energy radiation that
temporarily enhance the D-region of the ionosphere and attenuate low-frequency
radio waves. To track these Sudden Ionospheric Disturbances (SIDs), which
disrupt communication signals and perturb satellite orbits, Scherrer et al.
(2008) developed an international, ground-based network of around 500 SID
monitors that measure the signal strength of low-frequency radio waves.
However, these monitors suffer from a host of noise contamination issues that
preclude their use for rigorous scientific analysis. As such, we attempt to
create an algorithm to automatically identify noisy, contaminated SID data sets
from clean ones. To do so, we develop a set of features to characterize times
series measurements from SID monitors and use these features, along with a
binary classifer called a support vector machine, to automatically assess the
quality of the SID data. We compute the True Skill Score, a metric that
measures the performance of our classifier, and find that it is ~0.75+/-0.06.
We find features characterizing the difference between the daytime and
nighttime signal strength of low-frequency radio waves most effectively discern
noisy data sets from clean ones.",2018-09-08T02:23:46Z
"Optimal Classification and Outlier Detection for Stripped-Envelope
  Core-Collapse Supernovae","In the current era of time-domain astronomy, it is increasingly important to
have rigorous, data driven models for classifying transients, including
supernovae. We present the first application of Principal Component Analysis to
the spectra of stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae. We use one of the
largest compiled optical datasets of stripped-envelope supernovae, containing
160 SNe and 1551 spectra. We find that the first 5 principal components capture
79\% of the variance of our spectral sample, which contains the main families
of stripped supernovae: Ib, IIb, Ic and broad-lined Ic. We develop a
quantitative, data-driven classification method using a support vector machine,
and explore stripped-envelope supernovae classification as a function of phase
relative to V-band maximum light. Our classification method naturally
identifies ""transition"" supernovae and supernovae with contested labels, which
we discuss in detail. We find that the stripped-envelope supernovae types are
most distinguishable in the later phase ranges of $10\pm5$ days and $15\pm5$
days relative to V-band maximum, and we discuss the implications of our
findings for current and future surveys such as ZTF and LSST.",2019-03-15T21:53:15Z
Infrared $K_s$-band Photometry of Field RR Lyrae Variable Stars,"We present multi-epoch infrared photometry in the $K_s$-band for 74 bright RR
Lyrae variable stars tied directly to the 2MASS photometric system. We
systematize additional $K$-band photometry from the literature to the 2MASS
system and combine it to obtain photometry for 146 RR Lyrae stars on a
consistent, modern system. A set of outlier stars in the literature photometry
is identified and discussed. Reddening estimates for each star were gathered
from the literature and combined to provide an estimate of the interstellar
absorption affecting each star, and we find excellent agreement with another
source in the literature. We utilize trigonometric parallaxes from the Second
Data Release of ESA's Gaia astrometric satellite to determine the absolute
magnitude, $M_{K_s}$ for each of these stars, and analyze them using the
astrometry based luminosity prescription to obtain a parallax-based calibration
of $M_K$(RR). Our period-luminosity-metallicity relationship is $ M_{K_s} =
(-2.8\pm 0.2) (\log P +0.27) + (0.12\pm 0.02) ( [\mathrm{Fe/H}] + 1.3) -

"Detection of Hundreds of New Planet Candidates and Eclipsing Binaries in
  K2 Campaigns 0-8","We implement a search for exoplanets in campaigns zero through eight (C0-8)
of the K2 extension of the Kepler spacecraft. We apply a modified version of
the QATS planet search algorithm to K2 light curves produced by the EVEREST
pipeline, carrying out the C0-8 search on $1.5 \times 10^5$ target stars with
magnitudes in the range of Kp = 9-15. We detect 818 transiting planet
candidates, of which 374 were undiscovered by prior searches, with
{64,15,5,2,1} in {2,3,4,5,6}-planet multi-planet candidate systems,
respectively. Of the new planets detected, 100 orbit M dwarfs, including one
which is potentially rocky and in the habitable zone. 154 of our candidates
reciprocally transit with our Solar System: they are geometrically aligned to
see at least one Solar System planet transit. We find candidates which display
transit timing variations and dozens of candidates on both period extremes with
single transits or ultra-short periods. We point to evidence that our
candidates display similar patterns in frequency and size-period relation as
confirmed planets, such as tentative evidence for the radius gap. Confirmation
of these planet candidates with follow-up studies will increase the number of
K2 planets by up to 50%, and characterization of their host stars will improve
statistical studies of planet properties. Our sample includes many planets
orbiting bright stars amenable for radial velocity follow-up and future
characterization with JWST. We also list the 579 eclipsing binary systems
detected as part of this search.",2019-07-25T02:46:27Z
MAESTROeX: A Massively Parallel Low Mach Number Astrophysical Solver,"We present MAESTROeX, a massively parallel solver for low Mach number
astrophysical flows. The underlying low Mach number equation set allows for
efficient, long-time integration for highly subsonic flows compared to
compressible approaches. MAESTROeX is suitable for modeling full spherical
stars as well as well as planar simulations of dynamics within localized
regions of a star, and can robustly handle several orders of magnitude of
density and pressure stratification. Previously, we have described the
development of the predecessor of MAESTROeX, called MAESTRO, in a series of
papers. Here, we present a new, greatly simplified temporal integration scheme
that retains the same order of accuracy as our previous approaches. We also
explore the use of alternative spatial mapping of the one-dimensional base
state onto the full Cartesian grid. The code leverages the new AMReX software
framework for block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) applications,
allowing for scalability to large fractions of leadership-class machines. Using
our previous studies on the convective phase of single-degenerate progenitor
models of Type Ia supernovae as a guide, we characterize the performance of the
code and validate the new algorithmic features. Like MAESTRO, MAESTROeX is
fully open source.",2019-08-09T21:18:30Z
IRAS 09002-4732: A Laboratory for the Formation of Rich Stellar Clusters,"IRAS 09002-4732 is a poorly studied embedded cluster of stars in the Vela
Molecular Ridge at a distance of 1.7kpc. Deep observations with the Chandra
X-ray Observatory, combined with existing optical and infrared surveys, produce
a catalog of 441 probable pre-main sequence members of the region. The stellar
spatial distribution has two components: most stars reside in a rich, compact,
elliptical cluster, but a minority reside within a molecular filament several
parsecs long that straddles the cluster. The filament has active distributed
star formation with dozens of unclustered protostars. The cluster pre-main
sequence population is $\leq 0.8$ Myr old and deeply embedded; its most massive
member is extremely young producing an ultracompact H II region. The cluster
total population deduced from the X-ray luminosity function is surprisingly
rich, twice that of the Orion Nebula Cluster. The cluster core is remarkably
dense where strong N-body interactions should be occurring; its Initial Mass
Function may be deficient in massive stars. We infer that IRAS 09002-4732 is a

"Giant planet occurrence within 0.2 AU of low-luminosity red giant branch
  stars with K2","Every Sun-like star will eventually evolve into a red giant, a transition
which can profoundly affect the evolution of a surrounding planetary system.
The timescale of dynamical planet evolution and orbital decay has important
implications for planetary habitability, as well as post-main sequence star and
planet interaction, evolution and internal structure. Here, we investigate
these effects by estimating planet occurrence around 2476 low-luminosity red
giant branch (LLRGB) stars observed by the NASA K2 mission. We measure stellar
masses and radii using asteroseismology, with median random uncertainties of
3.7% in mass and 2.2% in radius. We compare this planet population to the known
population of planets around dwarf Sun-like stars, accounting for detection
efficiency differences between the stellar populations. We find that 0.51% +/-
0.29% of LLRGB stars host planets larger than Jupiter with orbital periods less
than 10 days, tentatively higher than main sequence stars hosting similar
planets (0.15% +/- 0.06%). Our results suggest that the effects of stellar
evolution on the occurrence of close-in planets larger than Jupiter is not
significant until stars have begun ascending substantially up the red giant
branch (>~ 5-6 Rsun).",2019-10-11T18:00:01Z
Upper Limits on Planet Occurrence around Ultracool Dwarfs with K2,"The occurrence of planets orbiting ultracool dwarfs is poorly constrained. We
present results from a Guest Observer program on NASA's K2 spacecraft to search
for transiting planets orbiting a sample of 827 ultracool dwarfs. Having found
no transiting planets in our sample, we determined an upper limit on the
occurrence of planets. We simulated planets orbiting our sample for a range of
orbital periods and sizes. For the simulated planets that transit their host,
we injected the transit light curve into the real K2 light curves, then
attempted to recover the injected planets. For a given occurrence rate, we
calculated the probability of seeing no planets, and use the results to place
an upper limit on planet occurrence as a function of planet radius and orbital
period. We find that short period, mini-Neptune- and Jupiter-sized planets are
rare around ultracool dwarfs, consistent with results for early- and mid-type M
dwarf stars. We constrain the occurrence rate $\eta$ for planets between $0.5$
and $10$ R$_{\oplus}$ with orbital periods between 1 and 26.3 days.",2019-12-09T19:00:00Z
"A Survey for New Stars and Brown Dwarfs in the Ophiuchus Star-forming
  Complex","We have performed a survey for new members of the Ophiuchus cloud complex
using high-precision astrometry from the second data release of Gaia, proper
motions measured with multi-epoch images from the Spitzer Space Telescope, and
color-magnitude diagrams constructed with photometry from various sources.
Through spectroscopy of candidates selected with those data, we have identified
155 new young stars. Based on available measurements of kinematics, we classify
102, 47, and six of those stars as members of Ophiuchus, Upper Sco, and other
populations in Sco-Cen, respectively. We have also assessed the membership of
all other stars in the vicinity of Ophiuchus that have spectroscopic evidence
of youth from previous studies, arriving at a catalog of 373 adopted members of
the cloud complex. For those adopted members, we have compiled mid-IR
photometry from Spitzer and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer} and have
used mid-IR colors to identify and classify circumstellar disks. We find that
210 of the members show evidence of disks, including 48 disks that are in
advanced stages of evolution. Finally, we have estimated the relative median
ages of the populations near the Ophiuchus clouds and the surrounding Upper Sco
association using absolute K-band magnitudes (M_K) based on Gaia} parallaxes.
If we adopt an age 10 Myr for Upper Sco, then the relative values of M_K imply
median ages of ~2 Myr for L1689 and embedded stars in L1688, 3-4 Myr for
low-extinction stars near L1688, and ~6 Myr for the group containing rho Oph.",2020-05-20T14:58:00Z
Refining the Census of the Upper Scorpius Association with Gaia,"We have refined the census of stars and brown dwarfs in the Upper Sco
association (~10 Myr, ~145 pc) by 1) updating the selection of candidate
members from our previous survey to include the high-precision astrometry from
the second data release of Gaia, 2) obtaining spectra of a few hundred
candidate members to measure their spectral types and verify their youth, and
3) assessing the membership (largely with Gaia astrometry) of 2020 stars toward
Upper Sco that show evidence of youth in this work and previous studies. We
arrive at a catalog of 1761 objects that are adopted as members of Upper Sco.
The distribution of spectral types among the adopted members is similar to
those in other nearby star-forming regions, indicating a similar initial mass
function. In previous studies, we have compiled mid-infrared photometry from
WISE and the Spitzer Space Telescope for members of Upper Sco and used those
data to identify the stars that show evidence of circumstellar disks; we
present the same analysis for our new catalog of members. As in earlier work,
we find that the fraction of members with disks increases with lower stellar
masses, ranging from <=10% for >1 Msun to ~22% for 0.01-0.3 Msun. Finally, we
have estimated the relative ages of Upper Sco and other young associations
using their sequences of low-mass stars in M(G_RP) versus G_BP-G_RP. This
comparison indicates that Upper Sco is a factor of two younger than the beta
Pic association (21-24 Myr) according to both non-magnetic and magnetic
evolutionary models.",2020-05-20T15:22:35Z
"Scaling K2. I. Revised Parameters for 222,088 K2 Stars and a K2 Planet
  Radius Valley at 1.9 $R_{\oplus}$","Previous measurements of stellar properties for K2 stars in the Ecliptic
Plane Input Catalog (EPIC; Huber et al. 2016) largely relied on photometry and
proper motion measurements, with some added information from available spectra
and parallaxes. Combining Gaia DR2 distances with spectroscopic measurements of
effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities from the Large Sky
Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) DR5, we computed
updated stellar radii and masses for 26,838 K2 stars. For 195,250 targets
without a LAMOST spectrum, we derived stellar parameters using random forest
regression on photometric colors trained on the LAMOST sample. In total, we
measured spectral types, effective temperatures, surface gravities,
metallicities, radii, and masses for 222,088 A, F, G, K, and M-type K2 stars.
With these new stellar radii, we performed a simple reanalysis of 299 confirmed
and 517 candidate K2 planet radii from Campaigns 1--13, elucidating a distinct
planet radius valley around 1.9 $R_{\oplus}$, a feature thus far only
conclusively identified with Kepler planets, and tentatively identified with K2
planets. These updated stellar parameters are a crucial step in the process
toward computing K2 planet occurrence rates.",2020-01-30T19:00:01Z
Physical and chemical properties of Wolf-Rayet planetary nebulae,"Wolf-Rayet ([WR]) and weak emission-line ($wels$) central stars of planetary
nebulae (PNe) have hydrogen-deficient atmospheres, whose origins are not well
understood. In the present study, we have conducted plasma diagnostics and
abundance analyses of 18 Galactic PNe surrounding [WR] and $wels$ nuclei, using
collisionally excited lines (CELs) and optical recombination lines (ORLs)
measured with the Wide Field Spectrograph on the ANU 2.3-m telescope at the
Siding Spring Observatory complemented with optical archival data. Our plasma
diagnostics imply that the electron densities and temperatures derived from
CELs are correlated with the intrinsic nebular H$\beta$ surface brightness and
excitation class, respectively. Self-consistent plasma diagnostics of heavy
element ORLs of N${}^{2+}$ and O${}^{2+}$ suggest that a small fraction of cool
($\lesssim 7000$ K), dense ($\sim 10^4-10^5$ cm$^{-3}$) materials may be
present in some objects, though with large uncertainties. Our abundance
analyses indicate that the abundance discrepancy factors (ADF$\equiv$ORLs/CELs)
of O${}^{2+}$ are correlated with the dichotomies between forbidden-line and He
I temperatures. Our results likely point to the presence of a tiny fraction of
cool, oxygen-rich dense clumps within the diffuse warm ionized nebulae.
Moreover, our elemental abundances derived from CELs are mostly consistent with
AGB models in the range of initial masses from 1.5 to 5M$_{\odot}$. Further
studies are necessary to understand better the origins of abundance
discrepancies in PNe around [WR] and $wels$ stars.",2021-06-20T22:18:14Z
"The Araucaria Project: The distance to the Fornax Dwarf Galaxy from
  near-infrared photometry of RR Lyrae stars","We have obtained single-phase near-infrared (NIR) magnitudes in the J- and
K-bands for 77 RR Lyrae (RRL) stars in the Fornax Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy. We
have used different theoretical and empirical NIR period-luminosity-metallicity
calibrations for RRL stars to derive their absolute magnitudes, and found a
true, reddening-corrected distance modulus of 20.818 +/- 0.015 (statistical)
+/- 0.116 (systematic) mag. This value is in excellent agreement with the
results obtained within the Araucaria Project from the NIR photometry of red
clump stars (20.858 +/- 0.013 mag), the tip of the red giant branch (20.84 +/-
0.04 +/- 0.14 mag), as well as with other independent distance determinations
to this galaxy. The effect of metallicity and reddening is substantially
reduced in the NIR domain, making this method a robust tool for accurate
distance determination at the 5 percent level. This precision is expected to
reach the level of 3 percent once the zero points of distance calibrations are
refined thanks to the Gaia mission. NIR period-luminosity-metallicity relations
of RRL stars are particularly useful for distance determinations to galaxies
and globular clusters up to 300 kpc, that lack young standard candles, like
Cepheids.",2017-10-25T07:59:54Z
"Catalog of Chromium, Cobalt, and Nickel Abundances in Globular Clusters
  and Dwarf Galaxies","We present measurements of the abundances of chromium, cobalt, and nickel in
4113 red giants, including 2277 stars in globular clusters, 1820 stars in the
Milky Way's dwarf satellite galaxies, and 16 field stars. We measured the
abundances from mostly archival Keck/DEIMOS medium-resolution spectroscopy with
a resolving power of R ~ 6500 and a wavelength range of approximately 6500-9000
A. The abundances were determined by fitting spectral regions that contain
absorption lines of the elements under consideration. We used estimates of
temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity that we previously determined
from the same spectra. We estimated systematic error by examining the
dispersion of abundances within mono-metallic globular clusters. The median
uncertainties for [Cr/Fe], [Co/Fe], and [Ni/Fe] are 0.20, 0.20, and 0.13,
respectively. Finally, we validated our estimations of uncertainty through
duplicate measurements, and we evaluated the accuracy and precision of our
measurements through comparison to high-resolution spectroscopic measurements
of the same stars.",2019-06-19T18:04:29Z
"Optical, J, and K light curves of XTE J1118+480 = KV UMa: the mass of
  the black hole and the spectrum of the non-stellar component","Optical, J, and K photometric observations of the KV UMa black hole X-ray
nova in its quiescent state obtained in 2017-2018 are presented. A significant
flickering within light curves was not detected, although the average
brightness of the system faded by $\approx 0.1^m$ during 350 days. Changes in
the average brightness were not accompanied with the increase or the decrease
of the flickering. From the modelling of five light curves the inclination of
the KV UMa orbit and the black hole mass were obtained: $i=74^{\circ}\pm
4^{\circ}$, $M_{BH}=(7.06\div 7.24)M_{\odot}$ dependently on the used mass
ratio. The non-stellar component of the spectrum in the range $\lambda=6400\div
22000$\r{A} can be fitted by a power law $F_{\lambda}\sim \lambda^{\alpha}$,
$\alpha\approx -1.8$. The accretion disk orientation angle changed from one
epoch to another. The model with spots on the star was inadequate. Evolutionary
calculations using the ""Scenario Machine"" code were performed for low mass
X-ray binaries, a recently discovered anomalously rapid decrease of the orbital
period was taken into account. We showed that the observed decrease can be
consistent with the magnetic stellar wind of the optical companion which
magnetic field was increased during the common envelope stage. Several
constraints on evolutionary scenario parameters were done.",2019-09-12T10:34:52Z
"Core-Collapse Supernovae: From Neutrino-Driven 1D Explosions to Light
  Curves and Spectra","We present bolometric and broadband light curves and spectra for a suite of
core-collapse supernova models exploded self-consistently in spherical symmetry
within the PUSH framework. We analyze broad trends in these light curves and
categorize them based on morphology. We find these morphological categories
relate simply to the progenitor radius and the mass of the hydrogen envelope.
We present a proof-of-concept sensitive-variable analysis, indicating that an
important determining factor in the properties of a light curve within a given
category is $^{56}$Ni mass. We follow spectra from the photospheric to the
nebular phase. These spectra show characteristic iron-line blanketing at short
wavelengths and Doppler-shifted Fe II and Ti II absorption lines. To enable
this analysis, we develop a first-of-its-kind pipeline from a massive
progenitor model, through a self-consistent explosion in spherical symmetry, to
electromagnetic counterparts. This opens the door to more detailed analyses of
the collective properties of these observables. We provide a machine readable
database of our light curves and spectra online at go.ncsu.edu/astrodata.",2020-08-12T18:01:25Z
"The search for failed supernovae with the Large Binocular Telescope: a
  new candidate and the failed SN fraction with 11 yr of data","We present updated results of the Large Binocular Telescope Search for Failed
Supernovae. This search monitors luminous stars in 27 nearby galaxies with a
current baseline of 11~yr of data. We re-discover the failed supernova (SN)
candidate N6946-BH1 as well as a new candidate, M101-OC1. M101-OC1 is a blue
supergiant that rapidly disappears in optical wavelengths with no evidence for
significant obscuration by warm dust. While we consider other options, a good
explanation for the fading of M101-OC1 is a failed SN, but follow-up
observations are needed to confirm this. Assuming only one clearly detected
failed SN, we find a failed SN fraction $f = 0.16^{+0.23}_{-0.12}$ at 90
per~cent confidence. We also report on a collection of stars that show slow
($\sim$decade), large amplitude ($\Delta L/L > 3$) luminosity changes.",2021-04-07T18:00:02Z
"3D Parameter Maps of Red Clump Stars in the Milky Way -- Absolute
  Magnitudes and Intrinsic Colors","Red clump stars (RCs) are useful tracers of distances, extinction, chemical
abundances, and Galactic structures and kinematics. Accurate estimation of the
RC parameters -- absolute magnitude and intrinsic color -- is the basis for
obtaining high-precision RC distances. By combining astrometric data from Gaia,
spectroscopic data from APOGEE and LAMOST, and multi-band photometric data from
Gaia, APASS, Pan-STARRS1, 2MASS, and WISE surveys, we use the Gaussian process
regression to train machine learners to derive the multi-band absolute
magnitudes $M_\lambda$ and intrinsic colors $(\lambda_1-\lambda_2)_0$ for each
spectral RC. The dependence of $M_\lambda$ on metallicity decreases from
optical to infrared bands, while the dependence of $M_\lambda$ on age is
relatively similar in each band. $(\lambda_1-\lambda_2)_0$ are more affected by
metallicity than age. The RC parameters are not suitable to be represented by
simple constants but are related to the Galactic stellar population structure.
By analyzing the variation of $M_\lambda$ and $(\lambda_1-\lambda_2)_0$ in the
spatial distribution, we construct $(R, z)$ dependent maps of mean absolute
magnitudes and mean intrinsic colors of the Galactic RCs. Through external and
internal validation, we find that using three-dimensional (3D) parameter maps
to determine RC parameters avoids systematic bias and reduces dispersion by
about 20% compared to using constant parameters. Based on Gaia's EDR3 parallax,
our 3D parameter maps, and extinction-distance profile selection, we obtain a
photometric RC sample containing 11 million stars with distance and extinction
measurements.",2021-08-31T04:05:24Z
"No Such Thing as a Simple Flare: Substructure and QPPs Observed in a
  Statistical Sample of 20 Second Cadence TESS Flares","A 20 second cadence TESS monitoring campaign of 226 low-mass flare stars
during Cycle 3 recorded 3792 stellar flares of >10^32 erg. We explore the
time-resolved emission and substructure in 440 of the largest flares observed
at high S/N, 97% of which released energies of >10^33 erg. We discover
degeneracy present at 2 minute cadence between sharply-peaked and weakly-peaked
flares is common, although 20 second cadence breaks these degeneracies. We
better resolve the rise phases and find 46% of large flares exhibit
substructure during the rise phase. We observe 49 candidate quasi-periodic
pulsations (QPP) and confirm 17 at 3+ sigma. Most of our QPPs have periods less
than 10 minutes, suggesting short period optical QPPs are common. We find QPPs
in both the rise and decay phases of flares, including a rise-phase QPP in a
large flare from Proxima Cen. We confirm the Davenport et al. (2014) template
provides a good fit to most classical flares observed at high cadence, although
9% favor Gaussian peaks instead. We characterize the properties of complex
flares, finding 17% of complex flares exhibit ""peak-bump"" morphologies composed
of a large, highly impulsive peak followed by a second more gradual Gaussian
peak. We also estimate the UVC surface fluences of temperate planets at flare
peak and find 1/3 of 10^34 erg flares reach the D90 dose of D. Radiodurans in
just 20 seconds in the absence of an atmosphere.",2021-10-25T18:00:01Z
"Stars in the Local Galactic Thick Disk and Halo in Gaia EDR3: A
  catalogue of Half a Million Local Main-sequence Stars with Photometric
  Metallicities","We present a catalogue of 551,214 main-sequence stars in the local ($d < 2$
kpc) Galactic thick disk and halo, based on a search of stars with large proper
motions ($\mu_{\mathrm{tot}} > 40.0$ mas/yr) in the Gaia Early Data Release 3.
We derive photometric metallicity calibrated from the
colour-luminosity-metallicity distribution of 20,047 stars with spectroscopic
metallicities, collected from various spectroscopic surveys, including SDSS
SEGUE/APOGEE, GALAH DR3, and LAMOST DR6. We combine these results to construct
an empirical colour-magnitude-metallicity grid, which can be used to estimate
photometric metallicities for low-mass metal-poor stars of K and M subtypes
from their absolute $G$ magnitude and colour values. We find that low-mass,
high-velocity stars in our catalogue share similar kinematics as reported in
recent studies of more luminous Galactic halo stars. The pseudo-kinematic
analysis of our sample recovers the main local halo structures, including the
Gaia-Enceladus Stream and the Helmi stream; aside from these the local halo
stars appear to show a remarkably smooth distribution in velocity space. Since
the future Gaia data release will provide radial velocity measurements for only
a small number of our sample, our catalogue provides targets of high interest
for the future spectroscopic observation programs like SDSS-V, DESI MW survey,
WEAVE, and/or 4MOST.",2021-12-14T14:10:27Z
"The Flaring TESS Objects of Interest: Flare Rates for all Two Minute
  Cadence TESS Planet Candidates","Although more than 5000 TESS Objects of Interest have been cataloged, no
comprehensive survey of the flare rates of their host stars exists. We perform
the first flare survey of all 2250 non-retired TOIs with 2 min cadence light
curves to measure or place upper limits on their flare rates. We find 93
candidates orbit flare stars and measure their flare frequency distributions.
Across the sample, TOIs of <1.5R_Earth orbit flare stars more frequently than
do TOIs of 1.5<R<2.75R_Earth, 2.75<R<4R_Earth, or R<4R_Earth. We sort all TOI
host stars by their flare rate/upper limit, stellar mass, and distance to
create a flare ranking metric (FRM) to determine suitability for follow-up. The
FRM of each TOI is then checked against the expected signal-to-noise of
atmospheric features in transmission spectroscopy to locate the most promising
targets. We find 1/4 of terrestrial M-dwarf planets amenable to transmission
spectroscopy orbit flare stars. However, none of the M-dwarf hosts to
terrestrial planets are currently flaring at sufficient levels for >99.9%
atmospheric ozone depletion. We give the first upper limits on the flare rate
of the host star to TOI 700 d and explore the flare rates incident on young
planets such as DS Tuc Ab.",2022-03-03T19:00:01Z
"Population synthesis of AX J1745.6-2901 X-ray nova type binaries with
  rapidly decreasing orbital periods","The neutron star low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) AX J1745.6-2901 was detected an
anomalously fast decrease of orbital period. The decreasing rate of orbital
period exceeds the contribution of all processes extracting angular momentum
from the binary star in standard model. Using SCENARIO MACHINE code we
conducted a population synthesis study of X-ray novae with neutron stars to
investigate a possible formation and evolution of such binaries. Such close
LMXBs should experience a preceding common envelope stage, in which the
magnetic fields of the low mass main-sequence donor stars can be dramatically
amplified. Our calculations show that the magnetic stellar wind of the optical
companion can efficiently extract angular momentum from the binary systems, and
produce the observed orbital-period derivatives of AX J1745.6-2901 and black
hole LMXBs. The estimated values of the required magnetic field induction are
following: $B_\textrm{d}\approx 400$ G (AX~J1745.6-2901), $B_\textrm{d}\approx
1500$ G (KV UMa), $B_\textrm{d}\approx 400$ G (A0620-00), $B_\textrm{d}\approx
1800$ G (Nova Muscae). We successfully reproduced the current observational
abundance of such anomalous neutron star X-ray novae, and computed the
appropriate value of the parameter of magnetic braking $\lambda_\textrm{MSW}$
($0.8-0.6$ for Roche lobe filling stars and $0.4-0.15$ for binaries with
partial Roche lobe filling).",2022-06-08T17:34:31Z
"Se-ResNet+SVM model: an effective method of searching for hot subdwarfs
  from LAMOST","In this paper, we apply the feature-integration idea to fuse the abstract
features extracted by Se-ResNet with experience features into hybrid features
and input the hybrid features to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify
Hot subdwarfs. Based on this idea, we construct a Se-ResNet+SVM model,
including a binary classification model and a four-class classification model.
The four-class classification model can further screen the hot subdwarf
candidates obtained by the binary classification model. The F1 values derived
by the binary and the four-class classification model on the test set are
96.17% and 95.64%, respectively. Then, we use the binary classification model
to classify 333,534 nonFGK type spectra in the low-resolution spectra of LAMOST
DR8 and obtain a catalog of 3,266 hot subdwarf candidates, of which 1223 are
newly-determined. Subsequently, the four-class classification model further
filtered the 3,266 candidates, 409 and 296 are newly-determined respectively
when the thresholds were set at 0.5 and 0.9. Through manual inspection, The
true number of hot subdwarfs in the three newly-determined canditates are 176,
63, and 41, the corresponding precision of the classification model in the
three cases are 67.94%, 84.88%, and 87.60%, respectively. Finally, we train a
Se-ResNet regression model with MAE values of 1212.65 K for Teff, 0.32 dex for
log g and 0.24 for [He/H], and predict the atmospheric parameters of these 176
hot subdwarf stars. This provides a certain amount of samples to help for
future studies of hot subdwarfs.",2022-12-20T15:52:03Z
The TIME Table: Rotation and Ages of Cool Exoplanet Host Stars,"Age is a stellar parameter that is both fundamental and difficult to
determine. Among middle-aged M dwarfs, the most prolific hosts of close-in and
detectable exoplanets, gyrochronology is the most promising method to assign
ages, but requires calibration by rotation-temperature sequences (gyrochrones)
in clusters of known ages. We curated a catalog of 249 late K- and M-type
(($T_{eff}$=3200-4200K) exoplanet host stars with established rotation periods,
and applied empirical, temperature-dependent rotation-age relations based on
relevant published gyrochrones, including one derived from observations of the
4 Gyr-old open cluster M67. We estimated ages for 227 of these stars, and upper
limits for 8 others, excluding 14 which have too rapidly rotating or are
otherwise outside the valid parameter range of our gyrochronology. We estimated
uncertainties based on observed scatter in rotation periods in young clusters,
error in the gyrochrones, and uncertainties in temperature and non-solar
metallicity. For those stars with measured metallicities, we provide but do not
incorporate a correction for the effects of deviation from solar metallicity.
The age distribution of our sample declines to near zero at 10 Gyr, the age of
the Galactic disk, with the handful of outliers explainable by large
uncertainties. Continued addition or extension of cluster rotation sequences to
more thoroughly calibrate the gyrochronology in time and temperature space,
more precise and robust measurement of rotation periods, and more accurate
stellar parameter measurements will enable continued improvements in the age
estimates of these important exoplanet host stars.",2023-01-28T06:38:46Z
"binary_c-python: A Python-based stellar population synthesis tool and
  interface to binary_c","We present the software package binary_c-python which provides a convenient
and easy-to-use interface to the binary_c framework, allowing the user to
rapidly evolve individual systems and populations of stars. binary_c-python is
available on Pip and on GitLab. binary_c-python contains many useful features
to control and process the output of binary_c, like by providing
binary_c-python with logging statements that are dynamically compiled and
loaded into binary_c. Moreover, we have recently added standardised output of
events like Roche-lobe overflow or double compact-object formation to binary_c,
and automatic parsing and managing of that output in binary_c-python.
binary_c-python uses multiprocessing to utilise all the cores on a particular
machine, and can run populations with HPC cluster workload managers like
HTCondor and Slurm, allowing the user to run simulations on large computing
clusters. We provide documentation that is automatically generated based on
docstrings and a suite of Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks consist of
technical tutorials on how to use binary_c-python and use-case scenarios aimed
at doing science. Much of binary_c-python is covered by unit tests to ensure
reliability and correctness, and the test coverage is continually increased as
the package is improved.",2023-06-05T11:04:17Z
Benchmarking Gaia DR3 Apsis with the Hyades and Pleiades open clusters,"The Gaia astrophysical parameters inference system (Apsis) provides
astrophysical parameter estimates for several to 100s of millions of stars. We
aim to benchmark Gaia DR3 Apsis. We have compiled about 1500 bona fide single
stars in the Hyades and Pleiades open clusters for validation of PARSEC
isochrones, and for comparison with Apsis estimates. PARSEC stellar isochrones
in the Gaia photometric system enable us to assign average ages and
metallicities to the clusters, and mass, effective temperature, luminosity, and
surface gravity to the individual stars. Apsis does not recover the single-age,
single-metallicity characteristic of the cluster populations. Ages assigned to
cluster members seemingly follow the input template for Galactic populations,
with earlier-type stars systematically being assigned younger ages than
later-type stars. Cluster metallicities are underestimated by 0.1 to 0.2 dex.
Effective temperature estimates are in general reliable. Surface gravity
estimates reveal strong systematics for specific ranges of Gaia BP-RP colours.
We caution that Gaia DR3 Apsis estimates can be subject to significant
systematics. Some of the Apsis estimates, like metallicity, might only be
meaningful for statistical studies of the time-averaged Galactic stellar
population, but are not recommended to be used for individual stars.",2023-06-05T18:00:03Z
"Calibration of metallicity of LAMOST M dwarf stars Using FGK+M wide
  binaries","Estimating precise metallicity of M dwarfs is a well-known difficult problem
due to their complex spectra. In this work, we empirically calibrate the
metallicity using wide binaries with a F, G, or K dwarf and a M dwarf
companion. With 1308 FGK+M wide binaries well observed by LAMOST, we calibrated
M dwarf's [Fe/H] by using the Stellar LAbel Machine (SLAM) model, a data-driven
method based on support vector regression (SVR). The [Fe/H] labels of the
training data are from FGK companions in range of [-1,0.5] dex. The Teffs are
selected from Li et al. (2021), spanning [3100,4400] K. The uncertainties in
SLAM estimates of [Fe/H] and Teff are ~0.15 dex and ~40 K, respectively, at
snri > 100, where snri is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at i-band of M dwarf
spectra. We applied the trained SLAM model to determine the [Fe/H] and Teff for
~630,000 M dwarfs with low-resolution spectra in LAMOST DR9. Compared to other
literature also using FGK+M wide binaries for calibration, our [Fe/H] estimates
show no bias but a scatter of ~ 0.14-0.18 dex. However, the [Fe/H] compared to
APOGEE shows a systematic difference of ~ 0.10-0.15 dex with a scatter of ~
0.15-0.20 dex. While the Teff compared to APOGEE has a bias of 3 K with a
scatter of 62 K, it is systematically higher by 180 K compared to other
calibrations based on the bolometric temperature. Finally, we calculated the
zeta index for 1308 M dwarf secondaries and presents a moderate correlation
between zeta and [Fe/H].",2023-12-20T08:08:11Z
The AO327 Drift Survey Catalog and Data Release of Pulsar Detections,"The AO327 drift survey for radio pulsars and transients used the Arecibo
telescope from 2010 until its collapse in 2020. AO327 collected ~3100 hours of
data at 327 MHz with a time resolution of 82 us and frequency resolution of 24
kHz. While the main motivation for such surveys is the discovery of new pulsars
and new, even unforeseen, types of radio transients, they also serendipitously
collect a wealth of data on known pulsars. We present an electronic catalog of
data and data products on 206 pulsars whose periodic emission was detected by
AO327 and are listed in the ATNF catalog of all published pulsars. The AO327
data products include dedispersed time series at full time resolution, average
(""folded"") pulse profiles, Gaussian pulse profile templates, and an absolute
phase reference that allows phase-aligning the AO327 pulse profiles in a
physically meaningful manner with profiles from data taken with other
instruments. We also provide machine-readable tables with uncalibrated flux
measurements at 327 MHz and pulse widths at 50% and 10% of the pulse peak
determined from the fitted Gaussian profile templates. The AO327 catalog data
set can be used in applications like population analysis of radio pulsars,
pulse profile evolution studies in time and frequency, cone and core emission
of the pulsar beam, scintillation, pulse intensity distributions, and others.
It also constitutes a ready-made resource for teaching signal processing and
pulsar astronomy techniques.",2024-01-03T19:16:40Z
An Eccentric Planet Orbiting the Polar V808 Aurigae,"We analyze 15 years of eclipse timings of the polar V808 Aur. The rapid
ingress/egress of the white dwarf and bright accretion region provide timings
as precise as a few tenths of a second for rapid cadence photometric data. We
find that between 2015 and 2018, the eclipse timings deviated from a linear
ephemeris by more than 30 s. The rapid timing change is consistent with the
periastron passage of a planet in an eccentric orbit about the polar. The best
fit orbital period is 11$\pm 1$ yr and we estimate a projected mass of
$Msin(i)=6.8\pm 0.7$ Jupiter masses. We also show that the eclipse timings are
correlated with the brightness of the polar with a slope of 1.1 s/mag. This is
likely due to the change in the geometry of the accretion curtains as a
function of the mass transfer rate in the polar. While an eccentric planet
offers an excellent explanation to the available eclipse data for V808 Aur,
proposed planetary systems in other eclipsing polars have often struggled to
accurately predict future eclipse timings.",2024-02-26T19:01:01Z
"Echo Location: Distances to Galactic Supernovae From ASAS-SN Light
  Echoes and 3D Dust Maps","Light echoes occur when light from a luminous transient is scattered by dust
back into our line of sight with a time delay due to the extra propagation
distance. We introduce a novel approach to estimating the distance to a source
by combining light echoes with recent three-dimensional dust maps. We identify
light echoes from the historical supernovae Cassiopeia A and Tycho's SN in
nearly a decade of imaging from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae
(ASAS-SN). Using these light echoes, we find distances of $3.6\pm0.1$ kpc and
$3.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ kpc to Cas A and Tycho, respectively, which are generally
consistent with previous estimates but are more precise. These distance
uncertainties are primarily dominated by the low distance resolution of the 3D
dust maps, which will likely improve in the future. The candidate single
degenerate explosion donor stars B and G in Tycho are clearly foreground stars.
Finally, the inferred reddening towards each SN agrees well with the
intervening H I column density estimates from X-ray analyses of the remnants.",2024-07-19T18:00:00Z
"Explorations Beyond the Snow Line: Spitzer/IRS Spectra of Debris Disks
  Around Solar-Type Stars","We have observed 152 nearby solar-type stars with the Infrared Spectrometer
(IRS) on the Spitzer Space Telescope. Including stars that met our criteria but
were observed in other surveys, we get an overall success rate for finding
excesses in the long wavelength IRS band (30-34 micron) of 11.8% +/- 2.4%. The
success rate for excesses in the short wavelength band (8.5-12 micron) is ~1%
including sources from other surveys. For stars with no excess at 8.5-12
microns, the IRS data set 3 sigma limits of around 1,000 times the level of
zodiacal emission present in our solar system, while at 30-34 microns set
limits of around 100 times the level of our solar system. Two stars (HD 40136
and HD 10647) show weak evidence for spectral features; the excess emission in
the other systems is featureless. If the emitting material consists of large
(10 micron) grains as implied by the lack of spectral features, we find that
these grains are typically located at or beyond the snow line, ~1-35 AU from
the host stars, with an average distance of 14 +/- 6 AU; however smaller grains
could be located at significantly greater distances from the host stars. These
distances correspond to dust temperatures in the range ~50-450 K. Several of
the disks are well modeled by a single dust temperature, possibly indicative of
a ring-like structure. However, a single dust temperature does not match the
data for other disks in the sample, implying a distribution of temperatures
within these disks. For most stars with excesses, we detect an excess at both
IRS and MIPS wavelengths. Only three stars in this sample show a MIPS 70 micron
excess with no IRS excess, implying that very cold dust is rare around
solar-type stars.",2009-09-01T00:42:17Z
"The Ultraviolet Radiation Environment Around M dwarf Exoplanet Host
  Stars","The spectral and temporal behavior of exoplanet host stars is a critical
input to models of the chemistry and evolution of planetary atmospheres. At
present, little observational or theoretical basis exists for understanding the
ultraviolet spectra of M dwarfs, despite their critical importance to
predicting and interpreting the spectra of potentially habitable planets as
they are obtained in the coming decades. Using observations from the Hubble
Space Telescope, we present a study of the UV radiation fields around nearby M
dwarf planet hosts that covers both FUV and NUV wavelengths. The combined
FUV+NUV spectra are publically available in machine-readable format. We find
that all six exoplanet host stars in our sample (GJ 581, GJ 876, GJ 436, GJ
832, GJ 667C, and GJ 1214) exhibit some level of chromospheric and transition
region UV emission. No ""UV quiet"" M dwarfs are observed. The bright stellar
Ly-alpha emission lines are reconstructed, and we find that the Ly-alpha line
fluxes comprise ~37-75% of the total 1150-3100A flux from most M dwarfs; >
10^{3} times the solar value. The F(FUV)/F(NUV) flux ratio, a driver for
abiotic production of the suggested biomarkers O2 and O3, is shown to be ~0.5-3
for all M dwarfs in our sample, > 10^{3} times the solar ratio. For the four
stars with moderate signal-to-noise COS time-resolved spectra, we find UV
emission line variability with amplitudes of 50-500% on 10^{2} - 10^{3} s
timescales. Finally, we observe relatively bright H2 fluorescent emission from
four of the M dwarf exoplanetary systems (GJ 581, GJ 876, GJ 436, and GJ 832).
Additional modeling work is needed to differentiate between a stellar
photospheric or possible exoplanetary origin for the hot (T(H2) \approx
2000-4000 K) molecular gas observed in these objects.",2012-12-19T21:00:01Z
The Occurrence Rate of Small Planets around Small Stars,"We use the optical and near-infrared photometry from the Kepler Input Catalog
to provide improved estimates of the stellar characteristics of the smallest
stars in the Kepler target list. We find 3897 dwarfs with temperatures below
4000K, including 64 planet candidate host stars orbited by 95 transiting planet
candidates. We refit the transit events in the Kepler light curves for these
planet candidates and combine the revised planet/star radius ratios with our
improved stellar radii to revise the radii of the planet candidates orbiting
the cool target stars. We then compare the number of observed planet candidates
to the number of stars around which such planets could have been detected in
order to estimate the planet occurrence rate around cool stars. We find that
the occurrence rate of 0.5-4 Earth radius planets with orbital periods shorter
than 50 days is 0.90 (+0.04/-0.03) planets per star. The occurrence rate of
Earth-size (0.5-1.4 Earth radius) planets is constant across the temperature
range of our sample at 0.51 (+0.06/-0.05) Earth-size planets per star, but the
occurrence of 1.4-4 Earth radius planets decreases significantly at cooler
temperatures. Our sample includes 2 Earth-size planet candidates in the
habitable zone, allowing us to estimate that the mean number of Earth-size
planets in the habitable zone is 0.15 (+0.13/-0.06) planets per cool star. Our
95% confidence lower limit on the occurrence rate of Earth-size planets in the
habitable zones of cool stars is 0.04 planets per star. With 95% confidence,
the nearest transiting Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of a cool star
is within 21 pc. Moreover, the nearest non-transiting planet in the habitable
zone is within 5 pc with 95% confidence.",2013-02-07T06:07:06Z
"Exploring the Variable Sky with LINEAR. II. Halo Structure and
  Substructure Traced by RR Lyrae Stars to 30 kpc","We present a sample of ~5,000 RR Lyrae stars selected from the recalibrated
LINEAR dataset and detected at heliocentric distances between 5 kpc and 30 kpc
over ~8,000 deg^2 of sky. The coordinates and light curve properties, such as
period and Oosterhoff type, are made publicly available. We find evidence for
the Oosterhoff dichotomy among field RR Lyrae stars, with the ratio of the type
II and I subsamples of about 1:4. The number density distribution of halo RRab
stars as a function of galactocentric distance can be described as an oblate
ellipsoid with the axis ratio q=0.63 and with either a single or a double power
law with a power-law index in the range -2 to -3. Using a group-finding
algorithm EnLink, we detected seven candidate halo groups, only one of which is
statistically spurious. Three of these groups are near globular clusters
(M53/NGC 5053, M3, M13), and one is near a known halo substructure (Virgo
Stellar Stream); the remaining three groups do not seem to be near any known
halo substructures or globular clusters, and seem to have a higher ratio of
Oosterhoff type II to Oosterhoff type I RRab stars than what is found in the
halo. The extended morphology and the position (outside the tidal radius) of
some of the groups near globular clusters is suggestive of tidal streams
possibly originating from globular clusters. Spectroscopic followup of detected
halo groups is encouraged.",2013-05-09T17:53:08Z
"Spectro-Thermometry of M dwarfs and their candidate planets: too hot,
  too cool, or just right?","We use moderate-resolution spectra of nearby late K and M dwarf stars with
parallaxes and interferometrically determined radii to refine their effective
temperatures, luminosities, and metallicities. We use these revised values to
calibrate spectroscopic techniques to infer the fundamental parameters of more
distant late-type dwarf stars. We demonstrate that, after masking out poorly
modeled regions, the newest version of the PHOENIX atmosphere models accurately
reproduce temperatures derived bolometrically. We apply methods to late-type
hosts of transiting planet candidates in the Kepler field, and calculate
effective temperature, radius, mass, and luminosity with typical errors of 57
K, 7%, 11%, and 13%, respectively. We find systematic offsets between our
values and those from previous analyses of the same stars, which we attribute
to differences in atmospheric models utilized for each study. We investigate
which of the planets in this sample are likely to orbit in the circumstellar
habitable zone. We determine that four candidate planets (KOI 854.01, 1298.02,
1686.01, and 2992.01) are inside of or within 1-sigma of a conservative
definition of the habitable zone, but that several planets identified by
previous analyses are not (e.g. KOI 1422.02 and KOI 2626.01). Only one of the
four habitable-zone planets is Earth sized, suggesting a downward revision in
the occurrence of such planets around M dwarfs. These findings highlight the
importance of measuring accurate stellar parameters when deriving parameters of
their orbiting planets.",2013-10-31T20:00:00Z
The Spatial Structure of Young Stellar Clusters. I. Subclusters,"The clusters of young stars in massive star-forming regions show a wide range
of sizes, morphologies, and numbers of stars. Their highly subclustered
structures are revealed by the MYStIX project's sample of 31,754 young stars in
nearby sites of star formation (regions at distances <3.6 kpc that contain at
least one O-type star.) In 17 of the regions surveyed by MYStIX, we identify
subclusters of young stars using finite mixture models -- collections of
isothermal ellipsoids that model individual subclusters. Maximum likelihood
estimation is used to estimate the model parameters, and the Akaike Information
Criterion is used to determine the number of subclusters. This procedure often
successfully finds famous subclusters, such as the BN/KL complex behind the
Orion Nebula Cluster and the KW-object complex in M17. A catalog of 142
subclusters is presented, with 1 to 20 subclusters per region. The subcluster
core radius distribution for this sample is peaked at 0.17 pc with a standard
deviation of 0.43 dex, and subcluster core radius is negatively correlated with
gas/dust absorption of the stars -- a possible age effect. Based on the
morphological arrangements of subclusters, we identify four classes of spatial
structure: long chains of subclusters, clumpy structures, isolated clusters
with a core-halo structure, and isolated clusters well fit by a single
isothermal ellipsoid.",2014-03-17T20:00:27Z
"The Occurrence of Potentially Habitable Planets Orbiting M Dwarfs
  Estimated from the Full Kepler Dataset and an Empirical Measurement of the
  Detection Sensitivity","We present an improved estimate of the occurrence rate of small planets
orbiting small stars by searching the full four-year Kepler data set for
transiting planets using our own planet detection pipeline and conducting
transit injection and recovery simulations to empirically measure the search
completeness of our pipeline. We identified 156 planet candidates, including
one object that was not previously identified as a Kepler Object of Interest.
We inspected all publicly available follow-up images, observing notes, and
centroid analyses, and corrected for the likelihood of false positives. We
evaluated the sensitivity of our detection pipeline on a star-by-star basis by
injecting 2000 transit signals into the light curve of each target star. For
periods shorter than 50 days, we find 0.56 (+0.06/-0.05) Earth-size planets
(1-1.5 Earth radii) and 0.46 (+0.07/-0.05) super-Earths (1.5-2 Earth radii) per
M dwarf. In total, we estimate a cumulative planet occurrence rate of
$2.5\pm0.2$ planets per M dwarf with radii 1-4 Earth radii and periods shorter
than 200 days. Within a conservatively defined habitable zone based on the
moist greenhouse inner limit and maximum greenhouse outer limit, we estimate an
occurrence rate of 0.16 (+0.17/-0.07) Earth-size planets and 0.12 (+0.10/-0.05)
super-Earths per M dwarf habitable zone. Adopting the broader insolation
boundaries of the recent Venus and early Mars limits yields a higher estimate
of 0.24 (+0.18/-0.08) Earth-size planets and 0.21 (+0.11/-0.06) super-Earths
per M dwarf habitable zone. This suggests that the nearest potentially
habitable non-transiting and transiting Earth-size planets are $2.6\pm0.4$ pc
and 10.6 (+1.6/-1.8) pc away, respectively. If we include super-Earths, these
distances diminish to $2.1\pm0.2$ pc and 8.6 (+0.7/-0.8) pc.",2015-01-07T20:59:05Z
"The Spatial Structure of Young Stellar Clusters. II. Total Young Stellar
  Populations","We investigate the intrinsic stellar populations (estimated total numbers of
OB and pre-main-sequence stars down to 0.1 Mo) that are present in 17 massive
star-forming regions (MSFRs) surveyed by the MYStIX project. The study is based
on the catalog of >31,000 MYStIX Probable Complex Members with both
disk-bearing and disk-free populations, compensating for extinction,
nebulosity, and crowding effects. Correction for observational sensitivities is
made using the X-ray Luminosity Function (XLF) and the near-infrared Initial
Mass Function (IMF)--a correction that is often not made by infrared surveys of
young stars. The resulting maps of the projected structure of the young stellar
populations, in units of intrinsic stellar surface density, allow direct
comparison between different regions. Several regions have multiple dense
clumps, similar in size and density to the Orion Nebula Cluster. The highest
projected density of ~34,000 stars/pc^2 is found in the core of the RCW38
cluster. Histograms of surface density show different ranges of values in
different regions, supporting the conclusion of Bressert et al. (2010, B10)
that no universal surface-density threshold can distinguish between clustered
and distributed star-formation. However, a large component of the young stellar
population of MSFRs resides in dense environments of 200-10,000 stars/pc^2
(including within the nearby Orion molecular clouds), and we find that there is
no evidence for the B10 conclusion that such dense regions form an extreme
""tail"" of the distribution. Tables of intrinsic populations for these regions
are used in our companion study of young cluster properties and evolution.",2015-01-21T21:00:05Z
Carbon in Red Giants in Globular Clusters and Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies,"We present carbon abundances of red giants in Milky Way globular clusters and
dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Our sample includes measurements of carbon
abundances for 154 giants in the clusters NGC 2419, M68, and M15 and 398 giants
in the dSphs Sculptor, Fornax, Ursa Minor, and Draco. This sample doubles the
number of dSph stars with measurements of [C/Fe]. The [C/Fe] ratio in the
clusters decreases with increasing luminosity above log(L/L_sun) ~= 1.6, which
can be explained by deep mixing in evolved giants. The same decrease is
observed in dSphs, but the initial [C/Fe] of the dSph giants is not uniform.
Stars in dSphs at lower metallicities have larger [C/Fe] ratios. We hypothesize
that [C/Fe] (corrected to the initial carbon abundance) declines with
increasing [Fe/H] due to the metallicity dependence of the carbon yield of
asymptotic giant branch stars and due to the increasing importance of Type Ia
supernovae at higher metallicities. We also identified 11 very carbon-rich
giants (8 previously known) in three dSphs. However, our selection biases
preclude a detailed comparison to the carbon-enhanced fraction of the Milky Way
stellar halo. Nonetheless, the stars with [C/Fe] < +1 in dSphs follow a
different [C/Fe] track with [Fe/H] than the halo stars. Specifically, [C/Fe] in
dSphs begins to decline at lower [Fe/H] than in the halo. The difference in the
metallicity of the [C/Fe] ""knee"" adds to the evidence from [alpha/Fe]
distributions that the progenitors of the halo had a shorter timescale for
chemical enrichment than the surviving dSphs.",2015-01-27T21:00:01Z
Sizes and Shapes of Young Star Cluster Light Profiles in M83,"We measure the radii and two-dimensional light profiles of a large sample of
young, massive star clusters in M83 using archival HST/WFC3 imaging of seven
adjacent fields. We use GALFIT to fit the two-dimensional light profiles of the
clusters, from which we find effective (half-light) radii, core radii, and
slopes of the power-law (EFF) profile ($\eta$). We find lognormal distributions
of effective radius and core radius, with medians of $\approx$2.5 pc and
$\approx$1.3 pc, respectively. Our results provide strong evidence for a
characteristic size of young, massive clusters. The average effective radius
and core radius increase somewhat with cluster age. Little to no change in
effective radius is observed with increasing galactocentric distance, except
perhaps for clusters younger than 100 Myr. We find a shallow correlation
between effective radius and mass for the full cluster sample, but a stronger
correlation is present for clusters 200-300 Myr in age. Finally, the majority
of the clusters are best fit by an EFF model with index $\eta\leq3.0$. There is
no strong evidence for change in $\eta$ with cluster age, mass, or
galactocentric distance. Our results suggest that clusters emerge from early
evolution with similar radii and are not strongly affected by the tidal field
of M83. Mass loss due to stellar evolution and/or GMC interactions appear to
dominate cluster expansion in the age range we study.",2015-06-05T20:00:56Z
Young Stellar Objects in the Gould Belt,"We present the full catalog of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) identified in the
18 molecular clouds surveyed by the Spitzer Space Telescope ""cores to disks""
(c2d) and ""Gould Belt"" (GB) Legacy surveys. Using standard techniques developed
by the c2d project, we identify 3239 candidate YSOs in the 18 clouds, 2966 of
which survive visual inspection and form our final catalog of YSOs in the Gould
Belt. We compile extinction corrected SEDs for all 2966 YSOs and calculate and
tabulate the infrared spectral index, bolometric luminosity, and bolometric
temperature for each object. We find that 326 (11%), 210 (7%), 1248 (42%), and
1182 (40%) are classified as Class 0+I, Flat-spectrum, Class II, and Class III,
respectively, and show that the Class III sample suffers from an overall
contamination rate by background AGB stars between 25% and 90%. Adopting
standard assumptions, we derive durations of 0.40-0.78 Myr for Class 0+I YSOs
and 0.26-0.50 Myr for Flat-spectrum YSOs, where the ranges encompass
uncertainties in the adopted assumptions. Including information from
(sub)millimeter wavelengths, one-third of the Class 0+I sample is classified as
Class 0, leading to durations of 0.13-0.26 Myr (Class 0) and 0.27-0.52 Myr
(Class I). We revisit infrared color-color diagrams used in the literature to
classify YSOs and propose minor revisions to classification boundaries in these
diagrams. Finally, we show that the bolometric temperature is a poor
discriminator between Class II and Class III YSOs.",2015-08-13T12:52:19Z
An Increase in the Mass of Planetary Systems around Lower-Mass Stars,"Trends in the planet population with host star mass provide an avenue to
constrain planet formation theories. We derive the planet radius distribution
function for Kepler stars of different spectral types, sampling a range in host
star masses. We find that M dwarf stars have 3.5 times more small planets
(1.0-2.8 R_Earth) than main-sequence FGK stars, but two times fewer
Neptune-sized and larger planets (>2.8 R_Earth). We find no systematic trend in
the planet size distribution between spectral types F, G, and K to explain the
increasing occurrence rates. Taking into account the mass-radius relationship
and heavy-element mass of observed exoplanets, and assuming those are
independent of spectral type, we derive the inventory of the heavy-element mass
locked up in exoplanets at short orbits. The overall higher planet occurrence
rates around M stars are not consistent with the redistribution of the same
mass into more, smaller planets. At the orbital periods and planet radii where
Kepler observations are complete for all spectral types, the average
heavy-element mass locked up in exoplanets increases roughly inversely with
stellar mass from 4 M_Earth in F stars to 5 M_Earth in G and K stars to 7
M_Earth in M stars. This trend stands in stark contrast with observed
protoplanetary disk masses that decrease towards lower mass stars, and provides
a challenge for current planet formation models. Neither models of in situ
formation nor migration of fully-formed planets are consistent with these
results. Instead, these results are indicative of large-scale inward migration
of planetary building blocks --- either through type-I migration or radial
drift of dust grains --- that is more efficient for lower mass stars, but does
not result in significantly larger or smaller planets.",2015-10-08T20:05:44Z
"The rotation and Galactic kinematics of mid M dwarfs in the Solar
  Neighborhood","Rotation is a directly-observable stellar property, and drives magnetic field
generation and activity through a magnetic dynamo. Main sequence stars with
masses below approximately 0.35Msun (mid-to-late M dwarfs) are
fully-convective, and are expected to have a different type of dynamo mechanism
than solar-type stars. Measurements of their rotation rates provide insights
into these mechanisms, but few rotation periods are available for these stars
at field ages. Using photometry from the MEarth transit survey, we measure
rotation periods for 387 nearby, mid-to-late M dwarfs in the Northern
hemisphere, finding periods from 0.1 to 140 days. The typical detected rotator
has stable, sinusoidal photometric modulations at a semi-amplitude of 0.5 to
1%. We find no period-amplitude relation for stars below 0.25Msun and an
anti-correlation between period and amplitude for higher-mass M dwarfs. We
highlight the existence of older, slowly-rotating stars without H{\alpha}
emission that nevertheless have strong photometric variability. The Galactic
kinematics of our sample is consistent with the local population of G and K
dwarfs, and rotators have metallicities characteristic of the Solar
Neighborhood. We use the W space velocities and established age-velocity
relations to estimate that stars with P<10 days are on average <2 Gyrs, and
that those with P>70 days are about 5 Gyrs. The period distribution is mass
dependent: as the mass decreases, the slowest rotators at a given mass have
longer periods, and the fastest rotators have shorter periods. We find a lack
of stars with intermediate rotation periods. [Abridged]",2015-11-03T15:55:56Z
Lithium-Rich Giants in Globular Clusters,"Although red giants deplete lithium on their surfaces, some giants are
Li-rich. Intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars can generate Li
through the Cameron-Fowler conveyor, but the existence of Li-rich, low-mass red
giant branch (RGB) stars is puzzling. Globular clusters are the best sites to
examine this phenomenon because it is straightforward to determine membership
in the cluster and to identify the evolutionary state of each star. In 72 hours
of Keck/DEIMOS exposures in 25 clusters, we found four Li-rich RGB and two
Li-rich AGB stars. There were 1696 RGB and 125 AGB stars with measurements or
upper limits consistent with normal abundances of Li. Hence, the frequency of
Li-richness in globular clusters is (0.2 +/- 0.1)% for the RGB, (1.6 +/- 1.1)%
for the AGB, and (0.3 +/- 0.1)% for all giants. Because the Li-rich RGB stars
are on the lower RGB, Li self-generation mechanisms proposed to occur at the
luminosity function bump or He core flash cannot explain these four lower RGB
stars. We propose the following origin for Li enrichment: (1) All luminous
giants experience a brief phase of Li enrichment at the He core flash. (2) All
post-RGB stars with binary companions on the lower RGB will engage in mass
transfer. This scenario predicts that 0.1% of lower RGB stars will appear
Li-rich due to mass transfer from a recently Li-enhanced companion. This
frequency is at the lower end of our confidence interval.",2016-01-06T21:00:00Z
"Photometric Monitoring of the Coldest Known Brown Dwarf with the Spitzer
  Space Telescope","Because WISE J085510.83$-$071442.5 (hereafter WISE 0855-0714) is the coldest
known brown dwarf ($\sim250$ K) and one of the Sun's closest neighbors (2.2
pc), it offers a unique opportunity for studying a planet-like atmosphere in an
unexplored regime of temperature. To detect and characterize inhomogeneities in
its atmosphere (e.g., patchy clouds, hot spots), we have performed time-series
photometric monitoring of WISE 0855-0714 at 3.6 and 4.5 micron with the Spitzer
Space Telescope during two 23~hr periods that were separated by several months.
For both bands, we have detected variability with peak-to-peak amplitudes of
4-5% and 3-4% in the first and second epochs, respectively. The light curves
are semi-periodic in the first epoch for both bands, but are more irregular in
the second epoch. Models of patchy clouds have predicted a large increase in
mid-IR variability amplitudes (for a given cloud covering fraction) with the
appearance of water ice clouds at $T_{\rm eff}<$375 K, so if such clouds are
responsible for the variability of WISE 0855-0714, then its small amplitudes of
variability indicate a very small deviation in cloud coverage between
hemispheres. Alternatively, the similarity in mid-IR variability amplitudes
between WISE 0855-0714 and somewhat warmer T and Y dwarfs may suggest that they
share a common origin for their variability (i.e., not water clouds). In
addition to our variability data, we have examined other constraints on the
presence of water ice clouds in the atmosphere of WISE 0855-0714, including the
recent mid-IR spectrum from \citet{ske16}. We find that robust evidence of such
clouds is not yet available.",2016-09-19T18:30:27Z
"The H$α$ emission of nearby M dwarfs and its relation to stellar
  rotation","The high-energy emission from low-mass stars is mediated by the magnetic
dynamo. Although the mechanisms by which fully convective stars generate
large-scale magnetic fields are not well understood, it is clear that, as for
solar-type stars, stellar rotation plays a pivotal role. We present 270 new
optical spectra of low-mass stars in the Solar Neighborhood. Combining our
observations with those from the literature, our sample comprises 2202
measurements or non-detections of H$\alpha$ emission in nearby M dwarfs. This
includes 466 with photometric rotation periods. Stars with masses between 0.1
and 0.6 solar masses are well-represented in our sample, with fast and slow
rotators of all masses. We observe a threshold in the mass-period plane that
separates active and inactive M dwarfs. The threshold coincides with the
fast-period edge of the slowly rotating population, at approximately the
rotation period at which an era of rapid rotational evolution appears to cease.
The well- defined active/inactive boundary indicates that H$\alpha$ activity is
a useful diagnostic for stellar rotation period, e.g. for target selection for
exoplanet surveys, and we present a mass-period relation for inactive M dwarfs.
We also find a significant, moderate correlation between
$L_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}/L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ and variability amplitude: more active
stars display higher levels of photometric variability. Consistent with
previous work, our data show that rapid rotators maintain a saturated value of
$L_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}/L_{\mathrm{bol}}$. Our data also show a clear power-law
decay in $L_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}/L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ with Rossby number for slow
rotators, with an index of $-1.7 \pm 0.1$.",2016-11-10T21:00:14Z
"A Deep Proper Motion Catalog Within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
  Footprint. II. The White Dwarf Luminosity Function","A catalog of 8472 white dwarf (WD) candidates is presented, selected using
reduced proper motions from the deep proper motion catalog of Munn et al. 2014.
Candidates are selected in the magnitude range 16 < r < 21.5 over 980 square
degrees, and 16 < r < 21.3 over an additional 1276 square degrees, within the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging footprint. Distances, bolometric
luminosities, and atmospheric compositions are derived by fitting SDSS ugriz
photometry to pure hydrogen and helium model atmospheres (assuming surface
gravities log g = 8). The disk white dwarf luminosity function (WDLF) is
constructed using a sample of 2839 stars with 5.5 < M_bol < 17, with
statistically significant numbers of stars cooler than the turnover in the
luminosity function. The WDLF for the halo is also constructed, using a sample
of 135 halo WDs with 5 < M_bol < 16. We find space densities of disk and halo
WDs in the solar neighborhood of 5.5 +- 0.1 x 10^-3 pc^-3 and 3.5 +- 0.7 x
10^-5 pc^-3, respectively. We resolve the bump in the disk WDLF due to the
onset of fully convective envelopes in WDs, and see indications of it in the
halo WDLF as well.",2016-11-18T23:22:32Z
"Effective Radii of Young, Massive Star Clusters in Two LEGUS Galaxies","We present a study of the effective (half-light) radii and other structural
properties of a systematically selected sample of young, massive star clusters
(YMCs, $\geq$$5\times10^3$ M$_{\odot}$ and $\leq$200 Myr) in two nearby spiral
galaxies, NGC 628 and NGC 1313. We use Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/UVIS and
archival ACS/WFC data obtained by the Legacy Extragalactic UV Survey (LEGUS),
an HST Treasury Program. We measure effective radii with GALFIT, a
two-dimensional image-fitting package, and with a new technique to estimate
effective radii from the concentration index (CI) of observed clusters. The
distribution of effective radii from both techniques spans $\sim$0.5-10 pc and
peaks at 2-3 pc for both galaxies. We find slight positive correlations between
effective radius and cluster age in both galaxies, but no significant
relationship between effective radius and galactocentric distance. Clusters in
NGC 1313 display a mild increase in effective radius with cluster mass, but the
trend disappears when the sample is divided into age bins. We show that the
vast majority of the clusters in both galaxies are much older than their
dynamical times, suggesting they are gravitationally bound objects. We find
that about half of the clusters in NGC 628 are underfilling their Roche lobes,
based on their Jacobi radii. Our results suggest that the young, massive
clusters in NGC 628 and NGC 1313 are expanding due to stellar mass loss or
two-body relaxation and are not significantly influenced by the tidal fields of
their host galaxies.",2017-05-07T20:12:04Z
"ALMA observations of dust polarization and molecular line emission from
  the Class 0 protostellar source Serpens SMM1","We present high angular resolution dust polarization and molecular line
observations carried out with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) toward the Class 0 protostar Serpens SMM1. By complementing these
observations with new polarization observations from the Submillimeter Array
(SMA) and archival data from the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave
Astronomy (CARMA) and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescopes (JCMT), we can compare
the magnetic field orientations at different spatial scales. We find major
changes in the magnetic field orientation between large (~0.1 pc) scales --
where the magnetic field is oriented E-W, perpendicular to the major axis of
the dusty filament where SMM1 is embedded -- and the intermediate and small
scales probed by CARMA (~1000 AU resolution), the SMA (~350 AU resolution), and
ALMA (~140 AU resolution). The ALMA maps reveal that the redshifted lobe of the
bipolar outflow is shaping the magnetic field in SMM1 on the southeast side of
the source; however, on the northwestern side and elsewhere in the source, low
velocity shocks may be causing the observed chaotic magnetic field pattern.
High-spatial-resolution continuum and spectral-line observations also reveal a
tight (~130 AU) protobinary system in SMM1-b, the eastern component of which is
launching an extremely high-velocity, one-sided jet visible in both CO(2-1) and
SiO(5-4); however, that jet does not appear to be shaping the magnetic field.
These observations show that with the sensitivity and resolution of ALMA, we
can now begin to understand the role that feedback (e.g., from protostellar
outflows) plays in shaping the magnetic field in very young, star-forming
sources like SMM1.",2017-07-12T18:00:00Z
Binary Pulsar Distances and Velocities from Gaia Data Release 2,"The second data release from the Gaia mission (Gaia DR2) includes, among its
billion entries, as- trometric parameters for binary companions to a number of
known pulsars, including white dwarf companions to millisecond pulsars and the
non-degenerate components of so-called ""black widow"" and ""redback"" systems. We
find 22 such counterparts in DR2, of which 12 have statistically sig- nificant
measurements of parallax. These DR2 optical proper motions and parallaxes
provide new measurements of the distances and transverse velocities of the
associated pulsars. For the most part, the results agree with existing radio
interferometric and pulsar timing-based astrometry, as well as other distance
estimates based on photometry or associations, and for some pulsars they
provide the best known distance and velocity estimates. In particular, two of
these pulsars have no previous dis- tance measurement: PSR J1227$-$4853, for
which Gaia measures a parallax of $0.62\pm 0.16$ mas, and PSR J1431$-$4715,
with a Gaia parallax of $0.64\pm 0.16$ mas. Using the Gaia distance
measurements, we find that dispersion measure-based distance estimates
calculated using the NE2001 and YMW16 Galactic electron density models are on
average slightly underestimated, which may be a selection effect due to the
over-representation of pulsars at high Galactic latitudes in the present Gaia
sample. While the Gaia DR2 results do not quite match the precision that can be
achieved by dedicated pulsar timing or radio interferometry, taken together
they constitute a small but important improvement to the pulsar distance scale,
and the subset of millisecond pulsars with distances measured by Gaia may help
improve the sensitivity of pulsar timing arrays to nanohertz gravitational
waves.",2018-06-15T18:00:10Z
"Optical spectroscopy and demographics of redback millisecond pulsar
  binaries","We present the first optical spectroscopy of five confirmed (or strong
candidate) redback millisecond pulsar binaries, obtaining complete radial
velocity curves for each companion star. The properties of these millisecond
pulsar binaries with low-mass, hydrogen-rich companions are discussed in the
context of the 14 confirmed and 10 candidate field redbacks. We find that the
neutron stars in redbacks have a median mass of 1.78 +/- 0.09 M_sun with a
dispersion of sigma = 0.21 +/- 0.09. Neutron stars with masses in excess of 2
M_sun are consistent with, but not firmly demanded by, current observations.
Redback companions have median masses of 0.36 +/- 0.04 M_sun with a scatter of
sigma = 0.15 +/- 0.04, and a tail possibly extending up to 0.7-0.9 M_sun.
Candidate redbacks tend to have higher companion masses than confirmed
redbacks, suggesting a possible selection bias against the detection of radio
pulsations in these more massive candidate systems. The distribution of
companion masses between redbacks and the less massive black widows continues
to be strongly bimodal, which is an important constraint on evolutionary models
for these systems. Among redbacks, the median efficiency of converting the
pulsar spindown energy to gamma-ray luminosity is ~10%.",2018-12-11T19:00:00Z
"EvryFlare I: Long-term Evryscope Monitoring of Flares from the Cool
  Stars Across Half the Southern Sky","We search for superflares from 4,068 cool stars in 2+ years of Evryscope
photometry, focusing on those with high-cadence data from both Evryscope and
TESS. The Evryscope array of small telescopes observed 575 flares from 284
stars, with a median energy of 10^34.0 erg. Since 2016, Evryscope has enabled
the detection of rare events from all stars observed by TESS through
multi-year, high-cadence continuous observing. We report ~2X the previous
largest number of 10^34 erg high-cadence flares from nearby cool stars. We find
8 flares with amplitudes of 3+ g' magnitudes, with the largest reaching 5.6
magnitudes and releasing 10^36.2 erg. We observe a 10^34 erg superflare from
TOI-455 (LTT 1445), a mid-M with a rocky planet candidate. We measure the
superflare rate per flare-star and quantify the average flaring of active stars
as a function of spectral type, including superflare rates, FFDs, and typical
flare amplitudes in g'. We confirm superflare morphology is broadly consistent
with magnetic re-connection. We estimate starspot coverage necessary to produce
superflares, and hypothesize maximum-allowed superflare energies and
waiting-times between flares corresponding to 100% coverage of the stellar
hemisphere. We observe decreased flaring at high galactic latitudes. We explore
the effects of superflares on ozone loss to planetary atmospheres: we observe 1
superflare with sufficient energy to photo-dissociate all ozone in an
Earth-like atmosphere in one event. We find 17 stars that may deplete an
Earth-like atmosphere via repeated flaring. Of the 1822 stars around which TESS
may discover temperate rocky planets, we observe 14.6% +/- 2% emit large
flares.",2019-04-23T16:58:16Z
"EvryFlare II: Rotation Periods of the Cool Flare Stars in TESS Across
  Half the Southern Sky","We measure rotation periods and sinusoidal amplitudes in Evryscope light
curves for 122 two-minute K5-M4 TESS targets selected for strong flaring. The
Evryscope array of telescopes has observed all bright nearby stars in the
South, producing two-minute cadence light curves since 2016. Long-term,
high-cadence observations of rotating flare stars probe the complex
relationship between stellar rotation, starspots, and superflares. We detect
periods from 0.3487 to 104 d, and observe amplitudes from 0.008 to 0.216 g'
mag. We find the Evryscope amplitudes are larger than those in TESS with the
effect correlated to stellar mass (p-value=0.01). We compute the Rossby number
(Ro), and find our sample selected for flaring has twice as many intermediate
rotators (0.04<Ro<0.4) as fast (Ro<0.04) or slow (Ro>0.44) rotators; this may
be astrophysical or a result of period-detection sensitivity. We discover 30
fast, 59 intermediate, and 33 slow rotators. We measure a median starspot
coverage of 13% of the stellar hemisphere and constrain the minimum magnetic
field strength consistent with our flare energies and spot coverage to be 500
G, with later-type stars exhibiting lower values than earlier-types. We observe
a possible change in superflare rates at intermediate periods. However, we do
not conclusively confirm the increased activity of intermediate rotators seen
in previous studies. We split all rotators at Ro~0.2 into Prot<10 d and Prot>10
d bins to confirm short-period rotators exhibit higher superflare rates, larger
flare energies, and higher starspot coverage than do long-period rotators, at
p-values of 3.2 X 10^-5, 1.0 X 10^-5, and 0.01, respectively.",2019-07-24T21:31:27Z
Stellar Rotation in the Gaia Era: Revised Open Clusters Sequences,"The period versus mass diagrams (i.e., rotational sequences) of open clusters
provide crucial constraints for angular momentum evolution studies. However,
their memberships are often heavily contaminated by field stars, which could
potentially bias the interpretations. In this paper, we use data from Gaia DR2
to re-assess the memberships of seven open clusters with ground- and
space-based rotational data, and present an updated view of stellar rotation as
a function of mass and age. We use the Gaia astrometry to identify the cluster
members in phase-space, and the photometry to derive revised ages and place the
stars on a consistent mass scale. Applying our membership analysis to the
rotational sequences reveals that: 1) the contamination in clusters observed
from the ground can reach up to $\sim 35\%$; 2) the overall fraction of
rotational outliers decreases substantially when the field contaminants are
removed, but some outliers persist; 3) there is a sharp upper edge in the
rotation periods at young ages; 4) at young ages, stars in the 1.0-0.6 Msun
range inhabit a global maximum of rotation periods, potentially providing an
optimal window for habitable planets. Additionally, we see clear evidence for a
strongly mass-dependent spin-down process. In the regime where rapid rotators
are leaving the saturated domain, the rotational distributions broaden (in
contradiction with popular models), which we interpret as evidence that the
torque must be lower for rapid rotators than for intermediate ones. The cleaned
rotational sequences from ground-based observations can be as constraining as
those obtained from space.",2021-01-04T19:00:01Z
"Octo-Tiger: A New, 3D Hydrodynamic Code for Stellar Mergers that uses
  HPX Parallelisation","OCTO-TIGER is an astrophysics code to simulate the evolution of
self-gravitating and rotat-ing systems of arbitrary geometry based on the fast
multipole method, using adaptive mesh refinement. OCTO-TIGER is currently
optimised to simulate the merger of well-resolved stars that can be
approximated by barotropic structures, such as white dwarfs or main sequence
stars. The gravity solver conserves angular momentum to machine precision,
thanks to a correction algorithm. This code uses HPX parallelization, allowing
the overlap of work and communication and leading to excellent scaling
properties, allowing for the computation of large problems in reasonable
wall-clock times. In this paper, we investigate the code performance and
precision by running benchmarking tests. These include simple problems, such as
the Sod shock tube, as well as sophisticated, full, white-dwarf binary
simulations. Results are compared to analytic solutions, when known, and to
other grid based codes such as FLASH. We also compute the interaction between
two white dwarfs from the early mass transfer through to the merger and compare
with past simulations of similar systems. We measure OCTO-TIGERs scaling
properties up to a core count of 80,000, showing excellent performance for
large problems. Finally, we outline the current and planned areas of
development aimed at tackling a number of physical phenomena connected to
observations of transients.",2021-01-20T17:38:43Z
"Identifying two groups of massive stars aligned in the $l\sim38^{\circ}$
  Galactic direction","Context: Recent near-infrared data have contributed to unveil massive and
obscured stellar populations in both new and previously known clusters in our
Galaxy. These discoveries lead us to view the Milky Way as an active
star-forming machine. Aims: We look for young massive cluster candidates as
over-densities of OB-type stars. The first search, focused on the Galactic
direction $l=38^{\circ}$, resulted in the detection of two objects with a
remarkable population of OB-type star candidates. Methods: With a modified
version of the friends-of-friends algorithm AUTOPOP and using 2MASS and
UKIDSS-GPS near-infrared ($J$, $H$, and $K$) photometry for one of our cluster
candidates (named Masgomas-6) we selected 30 stars for multi-object and
long-slit $H$- and $K$-spectroscopy. With the spectral classification and the
near-infrared photometric data, we derive individual distance, extinction and
radial velocity. Results: Of the 30 spectroscopically observed stars, 20 are
classified as massive stars, including OB-types (dwarfs, giants and
supergiants), two red supergiants, two Wolf-Rayet (WR122-11 and the new
WR122-16), and one transitional object (the LBV candidate IRAS 18576+0341). The
individual distances and radial velocities do not agree with a single cluster,
indicating that we are observing two populations of massive stars in the same
line-of-sight: Masgomas-6a and Masgomas-6b. The first group of massive stars,
located at 3.9$^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ kpc, contains both Wolf-Rayets and most of the
OB-dwarfs, and Masgomas-6b, at $9.6\pm0.4$ kpc, hosts the LBV candidate and an
evolved population of supergiants. We are able to identify massive stars at two
Galactic arms, but we can not clearly identify whether these massive stars form
clusters or associations.",2018-01-26T06:01:01Z
"Rotation periods of TESS Objects of Interest from the Magellan-TESS
  Survey with multiband photometry from Evryscope and TESS","Stellar RV jitter due to surface activity may bias the RV semi-amplitude and
mass of rocky planets. The amplitude of the jitter may be estimated from the
uncertainty in the rotation period, allowing the mass to be more accurately
obtained. We find candidate rotation periods for 17 out of 35 TESS Objects of
Interest (TOI) hosting <3 R_Earth planets as part of the Magellan-TESS Survey,
which is the first-ever statistically robust study of exoplanet masses and
radii across the photo-evaporation gap. Seven periods are 3+ sigma detections,
two are 1.5+ sigma, and 8 show plausible variability but the periods remain
unconfirmed. The other 18 TOIs are non-detections. Candidate rotators include
the host stars of the confirmed planets L 168-9 b, the HD 21749 system, LTT
1445 A b, TOI 1062 b, and the L 98-59 system. 13 candidates have no counterpart
in the 1000 TOI rotation catalog of Canto Martins et al. (2020). We find
periods for G3-M3 dwarfs using combined light curves from TESS and the
Evryscope all-sky array of small telescopes, sometimes with longer periods than
would be possible with TESS alone. Secure periods range from 1.4 to 26 d with
Evryscope-measured photometric amplitudes as small as 2.1 mmag in g'. We also
apply Monte Carlo sampling and a Gaussian Process stellar activity model from
the code exoplanet to the TESS light curves of 6 TOIs to confirm the Evryscope
periods.",2021-06-29T18:00:06Z
A Census of Young Stars and Brown Dwarfs in IC 348 and NGC 1333,"We have obtained optical and near-infrared spectra of candidate members of
the star-forming clusters IC 348 and NGC 1333. We classify 100 and 42
candidates as new members of the clusters, respectively, which brings the total
numbers of known members to 478 and 203. We also have performed spectroscopy on
a large majority of the previously known members of NGC 1333 in order to
provide spectral classifications that are measured with the same scheme that
has been applied to IC 348 in previous studies. The new census of members is
nearly complete for Ks<16.8 at Aj<1.5 in IC 348 and for Ks<16.2 at Aj<3 in NGC
1333, which correspond to masses of <=0.01 Msun for ages of 3 Myr according to
theoretical evolutionary models. The faintest known members extend below these
completeness limits and appear to have masses of ~0.005 Msun. In
extinction-limited samples of cluster members, NGC 1333 exhibits a higher
abundance of objects at lower masses than IC 348. It would be surprising if the
initial mass functions of these clusters differ significantly given their
similar stellar densities and formation environments. Instead, it is possible
that average extinctions are lower for less massive members of star-forming
clusters, in which case extinction-limited samples could be biased in favor of
low-mass objects in the more heavily embedded clusters like NGC 1333. In the
H-R diagram, the median sequences of IC 348 and NGC 1333 coincide with each
other for the adopted distances of 300 and 235 pc, which would suggest that
they have similar ages. However, NGC 1333 is widely believed to be younger than
IC 348 based on its higher abundance of disks and protostars and its greater
obscuration. Errors in the adopted distances may be responsible for this
discrepancy.",2016-05-28T15:56:28Z
"Which feedback mechanisms dominate in the high-pressure environment of
  the Central Molecular Zone?","Supernovae (SNe) dominate the energy and momentum budget of stellar feedback,
but the efficiency with which they couple to the interstellar medium (ISM)
depends strongly on how effectively early, pre-SN feedback clears dense gas
from star-forming regions. There are observational constraints on the
magnitudes and timescales of early stellar feedback in low ISM pressure
environments, yet no such constraints exist for more cosmologically typical
high ISM pressure environments. In this paper, we determine the mechanisms
dominating the expansion of HII regions as a function of size-scale and
evolutionary time within the high-pressure ($P/k_\rm{B}$~$10^{7-8}$K cm$^{-3}$)
environment in the inner 100pc of the Milky Way. We calculate the thermal
pressure from the warm ionised ($P_\rm{HII}$; 10$^{4}$K) gas, direct radiation
pressure ($P_\rm{dir}$), and dust processed radiation pressure ($P_\rm{IR}$).
We find that (1) $P_\rm{dir}$ dominates the expansion on small scales and at
early times (0.01-0.1pc; $<$0.1Myr); (2) the expansion is driven by
$P_\rm{HII}$ on large scales at later evolutionary stages ($>0.1$pc; $>1$Myr);
(3) during the first ~1Myr of growth, but not thereafter, either $P_{\rm IR}$
or stellar wind pressure likely make a comparable contribution. Despite the
high confining pressure of the environment, natal star-forming gas is
efficiently cleared to radii of several pc within ~2Myr, i.e. before the first
SNe explode. This `pre-processing' means that subsequent SNe will explode into
low density gas, so their energy and momentum will efficiently couple to the
ISM. We find the HII regions expand to a radius of 3pc, at which point they
have internal pressures equal with the surrounding external pressure. A
comparison with HII regions in lower pressure environments shows that the
maximum size of all HII regions is set by pressure equilibrium with the ambient
ISM.",2020-09-08T18:00:01Z
ALMA-IRDC: Dense gas mass distribution from cloud to core scales,"Infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are potential hosts of the elusive early phases
of high-mass star formation (HMSF). Here we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
fragmentation properties of a sample of 10 IRDCs, which have been highlighted
as some of the best candidates to study HMSF within the Milky Way. To do so, we
have obtained a set of large mosaics covering these IRDCs with ALMA at band 3
(or 3mm). These observations have a high angular resolution (~3arcsec or
~0.05pc), and high continuum and spectral line sensitivity (~0.15mJy/beam and
~0.2K per 0.1km/s channel at the N2H+(1-0) transition). From the dust continuum
emission, we identify 96 cores ranging from low- to high-mass (M = 3.4 to
50.9Msun) that are gravitationally bound (alpha_vir = 0.3 to 1.3) and which
would require magnetic field strengths of B = 0.3 to 1.0mG to be in virial
equilibrium. We combine these results with a homogenised catalogue of
literature cores to recover the hierarchical structure within these clouds over
four orders of magnitude in spatial scale (0.01pc to 10pc). Using supplementary
observations at an even higher angular resolution, we find that the smallest
fragments (<0.02pc) within this hierarchy do not currently have the mass and/or
the density required to form high-mass stars. Nonetheless, the new ALMA
observations presented in this paper have facilitated the identification of 19
(6 quiescent and 13 star-forming) cores that retain >16Msun without further
fragmentation. These high-mass cores contain trans-sonic non-thermal motions,
are kinematically sub-virial, and require moderate magnetic field strengths for
support against collapse. The identification of these potential sites of
high-mass star formation represents a key step in allowing us to test the
predictions from high-mass star and cluster formation theories.",2021-03-16T15:11:27Z
"Testing the Limits of Precise Subgiant Characterization with APOGEE and
  Gaia: Opening a Window to Unprecedented Astrophysical Studies","Given their location on the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram, thoroughly
characterized subgiant stars can place stringent constraints on a wide range of
astrophysical problems. Accordingly, they are prime asteroseismic targets for
the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. In this work, we
infer stellar properties for a sample of 347 subgiants located in the TESS
Continuous Viewing Zones (CVZs), which we select based on their likelihood of
showing asteroseismic oscillations. We investigate how well they can be
characterized using classical constraints (photometry, astrometry), and
validate our results using spectroscopic values. We derive luminosities,
effective temperatures, and radii with mean 1$\sigma$ random (systematic)
uncertainties of 4.5% (2%), 33 K (60 K), and 2.2% (2%), as well as more
model-dependent quantities such as surface gravities, masses, and ages. We use
our sample to demonstrate that subgiants are ideal targets for mass and age
determination based on HR diagram location alone, discuss the advantages of
stellar parameters derived from a detailed characterization over widely
available catalogs, show that the generally used 3D extinction maps tend to
overestimate the extinction for nearby stars (distance $\lesssim$ 500 pc), and
find a correlation that supports the rotation-activity connection in post main
sequence stars. The complementary roles played by classical and asteroseismic
data sets will open a window to unprecedented astrophysical studies using
subgiant stars.",2021-04-15T18:00:02Z
"Measuring and Replicating the 1-20 um Energy Distributions of the
  Coldest Brown Dwarfs: Rotating, Turbulent and Non-Adiabatic Atmospheres","Cold, low-mass, field brown dwarfs are important for constraining the
terminus of the stellar mass function, and also for optimizing atmospheric
studies of exoplanets. In 2020 new model grids for such objects were made
available: Sonora-Bobcat and ATMO 2020. Also, new candidate cold brown dwarfs
were announced, and new spectroscopic observations at lambda ~4.8 um were
published. In this paper we present new infrared photometry for some of the
coldest brown dwarfs, and put the new data and models together to explore the
properties of these objects. We reconfirm the importance of mixing in these
atmospheres, which leads to CO and NH_3 abundances that differ by orders of
magnitude from chemical equilibrium values. We also demonstrate that the new
models retain the known factor >~3 discrepancy with observations at 2 <~ lambda
um <~ 4, for brown dwarfs cooler than 600 K. We show that the entire 1 <~
lambda um <~ 20 energy distribution of six brown dwarfs with 260 <= T_eff K <=
475 can be well reproduced, for the first time, by model atmospheres which
include dis-equilibrium chemistry as well as a photospheric temperature
gradient which deviates from the standard radiative/convective equilibrium
value. This change to the pressure-temperature profile is not unexpected for
rotating and turbulent atmospheres which are subject to diabatic processes. A
limited grid of modified-adiabat model colors is generated, and used to
estimate temperatures and metallicities for the currently known Y dwarfs. A
compilation of the photometric data used here is given in the Appendix.",2021-07-01T18:41:47Z
Multiwavelength properties of Miras,"We comprehensively study the variability of Miras in the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC) by simultaneous analysing light curves in 14 bands in the range of
0.5$-$24 microns. We model over 20-years-long, high cadence $I$-band light
curves collected by The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) and fit
them to light curves collected in the remaining
optical/near-infrared/mid-infrared bands to derive both the variability
amplitude ratio and phase-lag as a function of wavelength. We show that the
variability amplitude ratio declines with the increasing wavelength for both
oxygen-rich (O-rich) and carbon-rich (C-rich) Miras, while the variability
phase-lag increases slightly with the increasing wavelength. In a significant
number of Miras, mostly the C-rich ones, the spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) require a presence of a cool component (dust) in order to match the
mid-IR data. Based on SED fits for a golden sample of 140 Miras, we calculated
synthetic period-luminosity relations (PLRs) in 42 bands for the existing and
future sky surveys that include OGLE, The VISTA Near-Infrared $YJK_\mathrm{s}$
Survey of the Magellanic Clouds System (VMC), Legacy Survey of Space and Time
(LSST), Gaia, Spitzer, The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), The
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope
(formerly WFIRST), and The Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We show that the
synthetic PLR slope decreases with increasing wavelength for both the O-rich
and C-rich Miras in the range of 0.1$-$40 microns. Finally, we show the
location and motions of Miras on the color-magnitude (CMD) and color-color
(CCD) diagrams.",2021-07-07T18:00:02Z
"The OGLE Collection of Variable Stars. One Thousand Heartbeat Stars in
  the Galactic Bulge and Magellanic Clouds","We present a collection of 991 heartbeat star (HBS) candidates found in the
Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) project data archive. We
discuss the selection process of the HBS candidates and the structure of the
catalog itself. It consists of 512 stars located toward the Galactic bulge
(GB), 439 stars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and 40 in the
Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The collection contains two large groups of HBSs
with different physical properties. The main distinction between the two groups
is the evolutionary status of the primary star. The first group of about 100
systems contains a hot main-sequence (MS) or a Hertzsprung-gap primary star,
while the second group of about 900 systems includes a red giant (RG). For each
star, we provide two-decade-long time-series photometry, in the Cousins $I$-
and Johnson $V$-band filters, obtained by the OGLE project. We also present
basic observational information as well as orbital parameters derived from the
light curve modeling.",2021-09-29T18:00:00Z
"ALMA Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP): A Hot Corino
  Survey toward Protostellar Cores in the Orion Cloud","The presence of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the interstellar medium
(ISM) is of great interest since it may link to the origin and prevalence of
life in the universe. Aiming to investigate the occurrence of COMs and their
possible origins, we conducted a chemical census toward a sample of
protostellar cores as part of the ALMA Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold
Clumps (ALMASOP) project. We report the detection of 11 hot corino sources,
which exhibit compact emissions from warm and abundant COMs, among 56 Class 0/I
protostellar cores. All the hot corino sources discovered are likely Class 0
and their sizes of the warm region ($>$ 100 K) are comparable to 100 au. The
luminosity of the hot corino sources exhibits positive correlations with the
total number of methanol and the extent of its emissions. Such correlations are
consistent with the thermal desorption picture for the presence of hot corino
and suggest that the lower luminosity (Class 0) sources likely have a smaller
region with COMs emissions. With the same sample selection method and detection
criteria being applied, the detection rates of the warm methanol in the Orion
cloud (15/37) and the Perseus cloud (28/50) are statistically similar when the
cloud distances and the limited sample size are considered. Observing the same
set of COM transitions will bring a more informative comparison between the
cloud properties.",2022-01-07T15:27:06Z
"The California-Kepler Survey. X. The Radius Gap as a Function of Stellar
  Mass, Metallicity, and Age","In 2017, the California-Kepler Survey (CKS) published its first data release
(DR1) of high-resolution optical spectra of 1305 planet hosts. Refined CKS
planet radii revealed that small planets are bifurcated into two distinct
populations: super-Earths (smaller than 1.5 $R_E$) and sub-Neptunes (between
2.0 and 4.0 $R_E$), with few planets in between (the ""Radius Gap."") Several
theoretical models of the Radius Gap predict variation with stellar mass, but
testing these predictions are challenging with CKS DR1 due to its limited
$M_\star$ range of 0.8-1.4 $M_\odot$. Here, we present CKS DR2 with 411
additional spectra and derived properties focusing on stars of 0.5-0.8
$M_\odot$. We found the Radius Gap follows $R_p \propto P^m$ with $m = -0.10
\pm 0.03$, consistent with predictions of XUV- and core-powered mass-loss
mechanisms. We found no evidence that $m$ varies with $M_\star$. We observed a
correlation between the average sub-Neptune size and $M_\star$. Over 0.5 to 1.4
$M_\odot$, the average sub-Neptune grows from 2.1 to 2.6 $R_E$, following $R_p
\propto M_\star^\alpha$ with $\alpha = 0.25 \pm 0.03$. In contrast, there is no
detectable change for super-Earths. These $M_\star$-$R_p$ trends suggests that
protoplanetary disks can efficiently produce cores up to a threshold mass of
$M_c$, which grows linearly with stellar mass according to $M_c \approx 10
M_E~(M_\star / M_\odot)$. There is no significant correlation between
sub-Neptune size and stellar metallicity (over $-$0.5 to $+$0.5 dex) suggesting
a weak relationship between planet envelope opacity and stellar metallicity.
Finally, there is no significant variation in sub-Neptune size with stellar age
(over 1 to 10 Gyr), which suggests that the majority of envelope contraction
concludes after $\sim$1 Gyr.",2022-01-25T00:34:11Z
"Identification and spectroscopic characterization of 128 new Herbig
  stars","We present optical spectroscopy observations of 145 high-mass pre-main
sequence candidates from the catalogue of Vioque et al. (2020). From these, we
provide evidence for the Herbig nature of 128 sources. This increases the
number of known objects of the class by $\sim50\%$. We determine the stellar
parameters of these sources using the spectra and Gaia EDR3 data. The new
sources are well distributed in mass and age, with 23 sources between $4$-$8$
M$_{\odot}$ and 32 sources above $8$ M$_{\odot}$. Accretion rates are inferred
from H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ luminosities for 104 of the new Herbigs. These
accretion rates, combined with previous similar estimates, allow us to analyze
the accretion properties of Herbig stars using the largest sample ever
considered. We provide further support to the existence of a break in accretion
properties at $\sim3$-$4$ M$_{\odot}$, which was already reported for the
previously known Herbig stars. We re-estimate the potential break in accretion
properties to be at $3.87^{+0.38}_{-0.96}$ M$_{\odot}$. As observed for the
previously known Herbig stars, the sample of new Herbig stars independently
suggests intense inner-disk photoevaporation for sources with masses above
$\sim7$ M$_{\odot}$. These observations provide robust observational support to
the accuracy of the Vioque et al. (2020) catalogue of Herbig candidates.",2022-02-02T19:00:04Z
S-type stars discovered in Medium-Resolution Spectra of LAMOST DR9,"In this paper, we report on 606 S-type stars identified from Data Release 9
of the LAMOST medium-resolution spectroscopic (MRS) survey, and 539 of them are
reported for the first time. The discovery of these stars is a three-step
process, i.e., selecting with the ZrO band indices greater than 0.25, excluding
non-S-type stars with the iterative Support Vector Machine method, and finally
retaining stars with absolute bolometric magnitude larger than -7.1. The 606
stars are consistent with the distribution of known S-type stars in the
color-magnitude diagram. We estimated the C/Os using the [C/Fe] and [O/Fe]
provided by APOGEE and the MARCS model for S-type stars, respectively, and the
results of the two methods show that C/Os of all stars are larger than 0.5.
Both the locations on the color-magnitude diagram and C/Os further verify the
nature of our S-type sample. Investigating the effect of TiO and atmospheric
parameters on ZrO with the sample, we found that log g has a more significant
impact on ZrO than Teff and [Fe/H], and both TiO and log g may negatively
correlate with ZrO. According to the criterion of Tian et al. (2020), a total
of 238 binary candidates were found by the zero-point-calibrated radial
velocities from the officially released catalog of LAMOST MRS and the catalog
of Zhang et al. (2021). A catalog of these 606 S-type stars is available from
the following link https://doi.org/10.12149/101097.",2022-04-13T06:59:28Z
"A three-dimensional map of the Milky Way using 66,000 Mira variable
  stars","We study the three-dimensional structure of the Milky Way using 65,981 Mira
variable stars discovered by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment
(OGLE) survey. The spatial distribution of the Mira stars is analyzed with a
model containing three barred components that include the X-shaped boxy
component in the Galactic center (GC), and an axisymmetric disk. We take into
account the distance uncertainties by implementing the Bayesian hierarchical
inference method. The distance to the GC is $R_0 = 7.66 \pm 0.01
\mathrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.39 \mathrm{(sys.)}$ kpc, while the inclination of the
major axis of the bulge to the Sun-GC line-of-sight is $\theta = 20.2^\circ \pm
0.6^\circ \mathrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.7^\circ \mathrm{(sys.)} $. We present, for the
first time, a detailed three-dimensional map of the Milky Way composed of young
and intermediate-age stellar populations. Our analysis provides independent
evidence for both the X-shaped bulge component and the flaring disk (being
plausibly warped). We provide the complete dataset of properties of Miras that
were used for calculations in this work. The table includes: mean brightness
and amplitudes in nine photometric bands (covering a range of wavelength from
0.5 to 12 $\mu$m), photometric chemical type, estimated extinction, and
calculated distance with its uncertainty for each Mira variable. The median
distance accuracy to a Mira star is at the level of $6.6\%$.",2022-11-30T19:00:01Z
"Center-to-limb variation of spectral lines and continua observed with
  SST/CRISP and SST/CHROMIS","Observations of center-to-limb variations (CLV) of spectral lines and
continua provide a good test for the accuracy of models of solar and stellar
atmospheric structure and spectral-line formation. They are also widely used to
constrain elemental abundances and are becoming increasingly important in
atmospheric studies of exoplanets. However, only a few such data sets exist for
chromospheric lines. We aim to create a set of standard profiles by means of
mosaics made with the CRISP and CHROMIS instruments of the Swedish 1-m Solar
Telescope (SST), as well as to explore the robustness of said profiles obtained
using this method. For each spectral line we use a mosaic that ranges from the
center to the limb. Each of these mosaics are averaged down to 50 individual
spectral profiles, spaced by 0.02 in the $\mu$ scale. These profiles are
corrected for p-mode oscillations, and their line parameters (equivalent width,
line shift, full-width at half-maximum, and line depth) are then compared
against literature values where possible. We present a set of 50 average
profiles that are spaced equidistantly along the cosine of the heliocentric
angle ($\mu$) by steps of 0.02 for five continuum points between 4001 and 7772
\AA, as well as ten of the most commonly observed spectral lines at the SST (Ca
II H & K, H$\beta$, Mg I 5173 \AA, C I 5380 \AA, Fe I 6173 \AA, Fe I 6301 \AA,
H$\alpha$, O I 7772 \AA, and Ca II 8542 \AA). Center-to-limb variation of line
profiles and continua are shared in the CDS as machine-readable tables;

stellar atmospheres.",2022-12-07T22:52:53Z
"A catalogue of cataclysmic variables from 20 years of the Sloan Digital
  Sky Survey with new classifications, periods, trends and oddities","We present a catalogue of 507 cataclysmic variables (CVs) observed in SDSS I
to IV including 70 new classifications collated from multiple archival data
sets. This represents the largest sample of CVs with high-quality and
homogeneous optical spectroscopy. We have used this sample to derive unbiased
space densities and period distributions for the major sub-types of CVs. We
also report on some peculiar CVs, period bouncers and also CVs exhibiting large
changes in accretion rates. We report 70 new CVs, 59 new periods, 178
unpublished spectra and 262 new or updated classifications. From the SDSS
spectroscopy, we also identified 18 systems incorrectly identified as CVs in
the literature. We discuss the observed properties of 13 peculiar CVS, and we
identify a small set of eight CVs that defy the standard classification scheme.
We use this sample to investigate the distribution of different CV sub-types,
and we estimate their individual space densities, as well as that of the entire
CV population. The SDSS I to IV sample includes 14 period bounce CVs or
candidates. We discuss the variability of CVs across the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram, highlighting selection biases of variability-based CV detection.
Finally, we searched for, and found eight tertiary companions to the SDSS CVs.
We anticipate that this catalogue and the extensive material included in the
Supplementary Data will be useful for a range of observational population
studies of CVs.",2023-04-13T18:00:03Z
"Abundance Analysis of Stars at Large Radius in the Sextans Dwarf
  Spheroidal Galaxy","We present stellar parameters and chemical abundances of 30 elements for five
stars located at large radii (3.5-10.7 times the half-light radius) in the
Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We selected these stars using proper motions,
radial velocities, and metallicities, and we confirm them as metal-poor members
of Sextans with -3.34 <= [Fe/H] <= -2.64 using high-resolution optical spectra
collected with the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph. Four of the
five stars exhibit normal abundances of C (-0.34 <= [C/Fe] <= +0.36), mild
enhancement of the alpha elements Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti ([alpha/Fe] = +0.12 +/-
0.03), and unremarkable abundances of Na, Al, K, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Zn.
We identify three chemical signatures previously unknown among stars in
Sextans. One star exhibits large overabundances ([X/Fe] > +1.2) of C, N, O, Na,
Mg, Si, and K, and large deficiencies of heavy elements ([Sr/Fe] = -2.37 +/-
0.25, [Ba/Fe] = -1.45 +/- 0.20, [Eu/Fe] < +0.05), establishing it as a member
of the class of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars with no enhancement of
neutron-capture elements. Three stars exhibit moderate enhancements of Eu
(+0.17 <= [Eu/Fe] <= +0.70), and the abundance ratios among 12 neutron-capture
elements are indicative of r-process nucleosynthesis. Another star is highly
enhanced in Sr relative to heavier elements ([Sr/Ba] = +1.21 +/- 0.25). These
chemical signatures can all be attributed to massive, low-metallicity stars or
their end states. Our results, the first for stars at large radius in Sextans,
demonstrate that these stars were formed in chemically inhomogeneous regions,
such as those found in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.",2023-07-05T18:33:17Z
"The Strength and Variability of the Helium 10830 Å Triplet in Young
  Stars, with Implications for Exosphere Detection","Young exoplanets trace planetary evolution, particularly the atmospheric mass
loss that is most dynamic in youth. However, the high activity level of young
stars can mask or mimic the spectroscopic signals of atmospheric mass loss.
This includes the activity-sensitive He 10830 \AA\ triplet, which is an
increasingly important exospheric probe. To characterize the He-10830 triplet
at young ages, we present time-series NIR spectra for young transiting planet
hosts taken with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder. The He-10830 absorption
strength is similar across our sample, except at the fastest and slowest
rotation, indicating that young chromospheres are dense and populate metastable
helium via collisions. Photoionization and recombination by coronal radiation
only dominates metastable helium population at the active and inactive
extremes. Volatile stellar activity, such as flares and changing surface
features, drives variability in the He-10830 triplet. Variability is largest at
the youngest ages before decreasing to $\lesssim5-10$ m\AA\ (or 3%) at ages
above 300 Myr, with 6 of 8 stars in this age range agreeing with no intrinsic
variability. He-10830 triplet variability is smallest and age-independent at
the shortest timescales. Intrinsic stellar variability should not preclude
detection of young exospheres, except at the youngest ages. We recommend
out-of-transit comparison observations taken directly surrounding transit and
observation of multiple transits to minimize activity's effect. Regardless,
caution is necessary when interpreting transit observations in the context of
stellar activity, as many scenarios can lead to enhanced stellar variability
even on timescales of an hour.",2023-11-08T19:00:02Z
"Fundamental Properties of Kepler Planet-Candidate Host Stars using
  Asteroseismology","We have used asteroseismology to determine fundamental properties for 66
Kepler planet-candidate host stars, with typical uncertainties of 3% and 7% in
radius and mass, respectively. The results include new asteroseismic solutions
for four host stars with confirmed planets (Kepler-4, Kepler-14, Kepler-23 and
Kepler-25) and increase the total number of Kepler host stars with
asteroseismic solutions to 77. A comparison with stellar properties in the
planet-candidate catalog by Batalha et al. shows that radii for subgiants and
giants obtained from spectroscopic follow-up are systematically too low by up
to a factor of 1.5, while the properties for unevolved stars are in good
agreement. We furthermore apply asteroseismology to confirm that a large
majority of cool main-sequence hosts are indeed dwarfs and not misclassified
giants. Using the revised stellar properties, we recalculate the radii for 107
planet candidates in our sample, and comment on candidates for which the radii
change from a previously giant-planet/brown-dwarf/stellar regime to a
sub-Jupiter size, or vice versa. A comparison of stellar densities from
asteroseismology with densities derived from transit models in Batalha et al.
assuming circular orbits shows significant disagreement for more than half of
the sample due to systematics in the modeled impact parameters, or due to
planet candidates which may be in eccentric orbits. Finally, we investigate
tentative correlations between host-star masses and planet candidate radii,
orbital periods, and multiplicity, but caution that these results may be
influenced by the small sample size and detection biases.",2013-02-11T21:00:02Z
The MUSCLES Treasury Survey I: Motivation and Overview,"Ground- and space-based planet searches employing radial velocity techniques
and transit photometry have detected thousands of planet-hosting stars in the
Milky Way. The chemistry of these atmospheres is controlled by the shape and
absolute flux of the stellar spectral energy distribution, however, flux
distributions of relatively inactive low-mass stars are poorly known at
present. To better understand exoplanets orbiting low-mass stars, we have
executed a panchromatic (X-ray to mid-IR) study of the spectral energy
distributions of 11 nearby planet hosting stars, the {\it Measurements of the
Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary Systems}
(MUSCLES) Treasury Survey. The MUSCLES program consists of contemporaneous
observations at X-ray, UV, and optical wavelengths. We show that energetic
radiation (X-ray and ultraviolet) is present from magnetically active stellar
atmospheres at all times for stars as late as M5. Emission line luminosities of
\ion{C}{4} and \ion{Mg}{2} are strongly correlated with band-integrated
luminosities. We find that while the slope of the spectral energy distribution,
FUV/NUV, increases by approximately two orders of magnitude form early K to
late M dwarfs ($\approx$~0.01~to~1), the absolute FUV and XUV flux levels at
their corresponding habitable zone distances are constant to within factors of
a few, spanning the range 10~--~70 erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the habitable
zone. Despite the lack of strong stellar activity indicators in their optical
spectra, several of the M dwarfs in our sample show spectacular flare emission
in their UV light curves. Finally, we interpret enhanced $L(line)$/$L_{Bol}$
ratios for \ion{C}{4} and \ion{N}{5} as tentative observational evidence for
the interaction of planets with large planetary mass-to-orbital distance ratios
($M_{plan}$/$a_{plan}$) with the transition regions of their host stars.",2016-02-29T20:59:58Z
"Unveiling the Role of the Magnetic Field at the Smallest Scales of Star
  Formation","We report ALMA observations of polarized dust emission from the protostellar
source Ser-emb 8 at a linear resolution of 140 au. Assuming models of
dust-grain alignment hold, the observed polarization pattern gives a projected
view of the magnetic field structure in this source. Contrary to expectations
based on models of strongly magnetized star formation, the magnetic field in
Ser-emb 8 does not exhibit an hourglass morphology. Combining the new ALMA data
with previous observational studies, we can connect magnetic field structure
from protostellar core (~80,000 au) to disk (~100 au) scales. We compare our
observations with four magnetohydrodynamic gravo-turbulence simulations made
with the AREPO code that have initial conditions ranging from super-Alfv\'enic
(weakly magnetized) to sub-Alfv\'enic (strongly magnetized). These simulations
achieve the spatial dynamic range necessary to resolve the collapse of
protostars from the parsec scale of star-forming clouds down to the ~100 au
scale probed by ALMA. Only in the very strongly magnetized simulation do we see
both the preservation of the field direction from cloud to disk scales and an
hourglass-shaped field at < 1000 au scales. We conduct an analysis of the
relative orientation of the magnetic field and the density structure in both
the Ser-emb 8 ALMA observations and the synthetic observations of the four
AREPO simulations. We conclude that the Ser-emb 8 data are most similar to the
weakly magnetized simulations, which exhibit random alignment, in contrast to
the strongly magnetized simulation, where the magnetic field plays a role in
shaping the density structure in the source. In the weak-field case, it is
turbulence -- not the magnetic field -- that shapes the material that forms the
protostar, highlighting the dominant role that turbulence can play across many
orders of magnitude in spatial scale.",2017-06-12T18:46:05Z
Chemo-kinematics of the Milky Way from the SDSS-III MARVELS Survey,"Combining stellar atmospheric parameters, such as effective temperature,
surface gravity, and metallicity, with barycentric radial velocity data
provides insight into the chemo-dynamics of the Milky Way and our local
Galactic environment. We analyze 3075 stars with spectroscopic data from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) MARVELS radial velocity survey and
present atmospheric parameters for 2343 dwarf stars using the spectral indices
method, a modified version of the equivalent width method. We present
barycentric radial velocities for a sample of 2610 stars with a median
uncertainty of 0.3 km s$^{-1}$. We determine stellar ages using two independent
methods and calculate ages for 2335 stars with a maximum-likelihood isochronal
age-dating method and for 2194 stars with a Bayesian age-dating method. Using
previously published parallax data we compute Galactic orbits and space
velocities for 2504 stars to explore stellar populations based on kinematic and
age parameters. This study combines good ages and exquisite velocities to
explore local chemo-kinematics of the Milky Way, which complements many of the
recent studies of giant stars with the APOGEE survey, and we find our results
to be in agreement with current chemo-dynamical models of the Milky Way.
Particularly, we find from our metallicity distributions and velocity-age
relations of a kinematically-defined thin disk that the metal rich end has
stars of all ages, even after we clean the sample of highly eccentric stars,
suggesting that radial migration plays a key role in the metallicity scatter of
the thin disk. All stellar parameters and kinematic data derived in this work
are catalogued and published online in machine-readable form.",2018-03-30T17:20:19Z
"The Discovery of HD 37605c and a Dispositive Null Detection of Transits
  of HD 37605b","We report the radial-velocity discovery of a second planetary mass companion
to the K0 V star HD 37605, which was already known to host an eccentric, P~55
days Jovian planet, HD 37605b. This second planet, HD 37605c, has a period of
~7.5 years with a low eccentricity and an Msini of ~3.4 MJup. Our discovery was
made with the nearly 8 years of radial velocity follow-up at the Hobby-Eberly
Telescope and Keck Observatory, including observations made as part of the
Transit Ephemeris Refinement and Monitoring Survey (TERMS) effort to provide
precise ephemerides to long-period planets for transit follow-up. With a total
of 137 radial velocity observations covering almost eight years, we provide a
good orbital solution of the HD 37605 system, and a precise transit ephemeris
for HD 37605b. Our dynamic analysis reveals very minimal planet-planet
interaction and an insignificant transit time variation. Using the predicted
ephemeris, we performed a transit search for HD 37605b with the photometric
data taken by the T12 0.8-m Automatic Photoelectric Telescope (APT) and the
Microvariability and Oscillations of Stars (MOST) satellite. Though the APT
photometry did not capture the transit window, it characterized the stellar
activity of HD 37605, which is consistent of it being an old, inactive star,
with a tentative rotation period of 57.67 days. The MOST photometry enabled us
to report a dispositive null detection of a non-grazing transit for this
planet. Within the predicted transit window, we exclude an edge-on predicted
depth of 1.9% at >>10sigma, and exclude any transit with an impact parameter
b>0.951 at greater than 5sigma. We present the BOOTTRAN package for calculating
Keplerian orbital parameter uncertainties via bootstrapping. We found
consistency between our orbital parameters calculated by the RVLIN package and
error bars by BOOTTRAN with those produced by a Bayesian analysis using MCMC.",2012-10-25T20:00:02Z
Updated Parameters and a New Transmission Spectrum of HD 97658b,"Recent years have seen increasing interest in the characterization of
sub-Neptune sized planets because of their prevalence in the Galaxy, contrasted
with their absence in our solar system. HD 97658 is one of the brightest stars
hosting a planet of this kind, and we present the transmission spectrum of this
planet by combining four HST transits, twelve Spitzer/IRAC transits, and eight
MOST transits of this system. Our transmission spectrum has higher signal to
noise ratio than that from previous works, and the result suggests that the
slight increase in transit depth from wavelength 1.1 to 1.7 microns reported in
previous works on the transmission spectrum of this planet is likely
systematic. Nonetheless, our atmospheric modeling results are not conclusive as
no model provides an excellent match to our data. Nonetheless we find that
atmospheres with high C/O ratios (C/O >~ 0.8) and metallicities of >~ 100x
solar metallicity are favored. We combine the mid-transit times from all the
new Spitzer and MOST observations and obtain an updated orbital period of
P=9.489295 +/- 0.000005 d, with a best-fit transit time center at T_0 =
2456361.80690 +/- 0.00038 (BJD). No transit timing variations are found in this
system. We also present new measurements of the stellar rotation period (34 +/-
2 d) and stellar activity cycle (9.6 yr) of the host star HD 97658. Finally, we
calculate and rank the Transmission Spectroscopy Metric of all confirmed
planets cooler than 1000 K and with sizes between 1 and 4 R_Earth. We find that
at least a third of small planets cooler than 1000 K can be well characterized
using JWST, and of those, HD 97658b is ranked fifth, meaning it remains a
high-priority target for atmospheric characterization.",2020-04-07T18:00:01Z
"Estimating the Ultraviolet Emission of M dwarfs with Exoplanets from Ca
  II and H$α$","M dwarf stars are excellent candidates around which to search for exoplanets,
including temperate, Earth-sized planets. To evaluate the photochemistry of the
planetary atmosphere, it is essential to characterize the UV spectral energy
distribution of the planet's host star. This wavelength regime is important
because molecules in the planetary atmosphere such as oxygen and ozone have
highly wavelength dependent absorption cross sections that peak in the UV
(900-3200 $\r{A}$). We seek to provide a broadly applicable method of
estimating the UV emission of an M dwarf, without direct UV data, by
identifying a relationship between non-contemporaneous optical and UV
observations. Our work uses the largest sample of M dwarf star far- and near-UV
observations yet assembled. We evaluate three commonly-observed optical
chromospheric activity indices -- H$\alpha$ equivalent widths and log$_{10}$
L$_{H\alpha}$/L$_{bol}$, and the Mount Wilson Ca II H&K S and R$'_{HK}$ indices
-- using optical spectra from the HARPS, UVES, and HIRES archives and new HIRES
spectra. Archival and new Hubble Space Telescope COS and STIS spectra are used
to measure line fluxes for the brightest chromospheric and transition region
emission lines between 1200-2800 $\r{A}$. Our results show a correlation
between UV emission line luminosity normalized to the stellar bolometric
luminosity and Ca II R$'_{HK}$ with standard deviations of 0.31-0.61 dex
(factors of $\sim$2-4) about the best-fit lines. We also find correlations
between normalized UV line luminosity and H$\alpha$ log$_{10}$
L$_{H\alpha}$/L$_{bol}$ and the S index. These relationships allow one to
estimate the average UV emission from M0 to M9 dwarfs when UV data are not
available.",2020-09-16T18:01:23Z
"Masses and compositions of three small planets orbiting the nearby M
  dwarf L231-32 (TOI-270) and the M dwarf radius valley","We report on precise Doppler measurements of L231-32 (TOI-270), a nearby M
dwarf ($d=22$ pc, $M_\star = 0.39$ M$_\odot$, $R_\star = 0.38$ R$_\odot$),
which hosts three transiting planets that were recently discovered using data
from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The three planets are
1.2, 2.4, and 2.1 times the size of Earth and have orbital periods of 3.4, 5.7,
and 11.4 days. We obtained 29 high-resolution optical spectra with the newly
commissioned Echelle Spectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic
Observations (ESPRESSO) and 58 spectra using the High Accuracy Radial velocity
Planet Searcher (HARPS). From these observations, we find the masses of the
planets to be $1.58 \pm 0.26$, $6.15 \pm 0.37$, and $4.78 \pm 0.43$ M$_\oplus$,
respectively. The combination of radius and mass measurements suggests that the
innermost planet has a rocky composition similar to that of Earth, while the
outer two planets have lower densities. Thus, the inner planet and the outer
planets are on opposite sides of the `radius valley' -- a region in the
radius-period diagram with relatively few members, which has been interpreted
as a consequence of atmospheric photo-evaporation. We place these findings into
the context of other small close-in planets orbiting M dwarf stars, and use
support vector machines to determine the location and slope of the M dwarf
($T_\mathrm{eff} < 4000$ K) radius valley as a function of orbital period. We
compare the location of the M dwarf radius valley to the radius valley observed
for FGK stars, and find that its location is a good match to photo-evaporation
and core-powered mass loss models. Finally, we show that planets below the M
dwarf radius valley have compositions consistent with stripped rocky cores,

"AstroLLaMA-Chat: Scaling AstroLLaMA with Conversational and Diverse
  Datasets","We explore the potential of enhancing LLM performance in astronomy-focused
question-answering through targeted, continual pre-training. By employing a
compact 7B-parameter LLaMA-2 model and focusing exclusively on a curated set of
astronomy corpora -- comprising abstracts, introductions, and conclusions -- we
achieve notable improvements in specialized topic comprehension. While general
LLMs like GPT-4 excel in broader question-answering scenarios due to superior
reasoning capabilities, our findings suggest that continual pre-training with
limited resources can still enhance model performance on specialized topics.
Additionally, we present an extension of AstroLLaMA: the fine-tuning of the 7B
LLaMA model on a domain-specific conversational dataset, culminating in the
release of the chat-enabled AstroLLaMA for community use. Comprehensive
quantitative benchmarking is currently in progress and will be detailed in an
upcoming full paper. The model, AstroLLaMA-Chat, is now available at
https://huggingface.co/universeTBD, providing the first open-source
conversational AI tool tailored for the astronomy community.",2024-01-03T04:47:02Z
Gaia Data Release 3. Summary of the variability processing and analysis,"Context. Gaia has been in operations since 2014. The third Gaia data release
expands from the early data release (EDR3) in 2020 by providing 34 months of
multi-epoch observations that allowed us to probe, characterise and classify
systematically celestial variable phenomena.
  Aims. We present a summary of the variability processing and analysis of the
photometric and spectroscopic time series of 1.8 billion sources done for Gaia
DR3.
  Methods. We used statistical and Machine Learning methods to characterise and
classify the variable sources. Training sets were built from a global revision
of major published variable star catalogues. For a subset of classes, specific
detailed studies were conducted to confirm their class membership and to derive
parameters that are adapted to the peculiarity of the considered class.
  Results. In total, 10.5 million objects are identified as variable in Gaia
DR3 and have associated time series in G, GBP, and GRP and, in some cases,
radial velocity time series. The DR3 variable sources subdivide into 9.5
million variable stars and 1 million Active Galactic Nuclei/Quasars. In
addition, supervised classification identified 2.5 million galaxies thanks to
spurious variability induced by the extent of these objects. The variability
analysis output in the DR3 archive amounts to 17 tables containing a total of
365 parameters. We publish 35 types and sub-types of variable objects. For 11
variable types, additional specific object parameters are published. An
overview of the estimated completeness and contamination of most variability
classes is provided.
  Conclusions. Thanks to Gaia we present the largest whole-sky variability
analysis based on coherent photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic data.
Later Gaia data releases will more than double the span of time series and the
number of observations, thus allowing for an even richer catalogue in the
future.",2022-06-13T18:51:34Z
Gravitational Machines,"A gravitational machine is defined as an arrangement of gravitating masses
from which useful energy can be extracted. It is shown that such machines may
exist if the masses are of normal astronomical size. A simple example of a
gravitational machine, consisting of a double star with smaller masses orbiting
around it, is described. It is shown that an efficient gravitational machine
will also be an emitter of gravitational radiation. The emitted radiation sets
a limit on the possible performance of gravitational machines, and also
provides us with a possible means for detecting such machines if they exist.",2023-05-17T14:52:13Z
"Simulating 3-D Stellar Hydrodynamics using PPM and PPB Multifluid Gas

Results of recent simulations carried out at scale on the NSF's Blue Waters
machine at the University of Illinois are presented, with a special focus on
the computational challenges they address. Prospects for future work using
GPU-accelerated nodes such as those on the DoE's new Summit machine at Oak

"IAS15: A fast, adaptive, high-order integrator for gravitational
  dynamics, accurate to machine precision over a billion orbits","We present IAS15, a 15th-order integrator to simulate gravitational dynamics.
The integrator is based on a Gau\ss-Radau quadrature and can handle
conservative as well as non-conservative forces. We develop a step-size control
that can automatically choose an optimal timestep. The algorithm can handle
close encounters and high-eccentricity orbits. The systematic errors are kept
well below machine precision and long-term orbit integrations over $10^9$
orbits show that IAS15 is optimal in the sense that it follows Brouwer's law,
i.e. the energy error behaves like a random walk. Our tests show that IAS15 is
superior to a mixed-variable symplectic integrator (MVS) and other popular
integrators, including high-order ones, in both speed and accuracy. In fact,
IAS15 preserves the symplecticity of Hamiltonian systems better than the
commonly-used nominally symplectic integrators to which we compared it.
  We provide an open-source implementation of IAS15. The package comes with
several easy-to-extend examples involving resonant planetary systems,
Kozai-Lidov cycles, close encounters, radiation pressure, quadrupole moment,
and generic damping functions that can, among other things, be used to simulate
planet-disc interactions. Other non-conservative forces can be added easily.",2014-09-16T20:00:14Z
"A high performance and portable all-Mach regime flow solver code with
  well-balanced gravity. Application to compressible convection","Convection is an important physical process in astrophysics well-studied
using numerical simulations under the Boussinesq and/or anelastic
approximations. However these approaches reach their limits when compressible
effects are important in the high Mach flow regime, e.g. in stellar atmospheres
or in the presence of accretion shocks. In order to tackle these issues, we
propose a new high performance and portable code, called ""ARK"" with a numerical
solver well-suited for the stratified compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We
take a finite volume approach with machine precision conservation of mass,
transverse momentum and total energy. Based on previous works in applied
mathematics we propose the use of a low Mach correction to achieve a good
precision in both low and high Mach regimes. The gravity source term is
discretized using a well-balanced scheme in order to reach machine precision
hydrostatic balance. This new solver is implemented using the Kokkos library in
order to achieve high performance computing and portability across different
architectures (e.g. multi-core, many-core, and GP-GPU). We show that the
low-Mach correction allows to reach the low-Mach regime with a much better
accuracy than a standard Godunov-type approach. The combined well-balanced
property and the low-Mach correction allowed us to trigger Rayleigh-B\'enard
convective modes close to the critical Rayleigh number. Furthermore we present
3D turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection with low diffusion using the low-Mach
correction leading to a higher kinetic energy power spectrum. These results are
very promising for future studies of high Mach and highly stratified convective
problems in astrophysics.",2019-03-21T15:10:19Z
"Deriving the stellar labels of LAMOST spectra with Stellar LAbel Machine
  (SLAM)","The LAMOST survey has provided 9 million spectra in its Data Release 5 (DR5)
at R$\sim$1800. Extracting precise stellar labels is crucial for such a large
sample. In this paper, we report the implementation of the Stellar LAbel
Machine (SLAM), which is a data-driven method based on Support Vector
Regression (SVR), a robust non-linear regression technique. Thanks to the
capability to model highly non-linear problems with SVR, SLAM generally can
derive stellar labels over a wide range of spectral types. This gives it a
unique capability compared to other popular data-driven methods. To illustrate
this capability, we test the performance of SLAM on stars ranging from
Teff$\sim$4000 to $\sim$8000 K trained on LAMOST spectra and stellar labels. At
g-band signal-to-noise ratio (SNRg) higher than 100, the random uncertainties
of Teff, logg and [Fe/H] are 50 K, 0.09 dex, and 0.07 dex, respectively. We
then set up another SLAM model trained by APOGEE and LAMOST common stars to
demonstrate its capability of dealing with high dimensional problems. The
spectra are from LAMOST DR5 and the stellar labels of the training set are from
APOGEE DR15, including Teff, logg, [M/H],[$\alpha$/M], [C/M], and [N/M]. The
cross-validated scatters at SNRg$\sim$100 are 49 K, 0.10 dex, 0.037 dex,0.026
dex, 0.058 dex, and 0.106 dex for these parameters, respectively. This
performance is at the same level as other up-to-date data-driven models. As a
byproduct, we also provide the latest catalog of $\sim$1 million LAMOST DR5 K
giant stars with SLAM-predicted stellar labels in this work.",2019-08-23T05:58:11Z
Cosmological AMR MHD with Enzo,"In this work, we present MHDEnzo, the extension of the cosmological code Enzo
to include the effects magnetic fields through the ideal MHD approximation. We
use a higher order Godunov Riemann solver for the computation of interface
fluxes. We use two constrained transport methods to compute the electric field
from those interface fluxes, which simultaneously advances the induction
equation and maintains the divergence of the magnetic field. A third order
divergence free reconstruction technique is used to interpolate the magnetic
fields in the block structured AMR framework already extant in Enzo. This
reconstruction also preserves the divergence of the magnetic field to machine
precision. We use operator splitting to include gravity and cosmological
expansion. We then present a series of cosmological and non cosmological tests
problems to demonstrate the quality of solution resulting from this combination
of solvers.",2009-02-16T02:59:16Z
"Proton Mass, Topology Change and Tensor Forces in Compressed Baryonic
  Matter","This is a summary of the talks I gave at Korean Physical Society meeting
(April 26, 2012, Daejeon, Korea) and the 4th Asian Triangle Heavy Ion
Conference (ATHIC) (November 14, 2012, Pusan, Korea). They are based on the
series of work done at Hanyang University in the World Class University III
Program under the theme of ""From Dense Matter to Compact Stars."" The program
was conceived and executed to understand highly compressed baryonic matter in
anticipation of the forthcoming RIB machine ""RAON"" which is in construction in
the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in Korea. The problems treated ranged
from the origin of the proton mass, topological structure of barynic matter,
chiral symmetry and conformal symmetry to the EoS of nuclear matter and dense
neutron-rich matter and to the maximum mass of neutron stars. The results
obtained are new and intriguing and could have an impact on the novel structure
of dense matter to be probed in the accelerators ""RAON,"" FAIR etc. and in
compact stars.",2013-01-01T08:28:21Z
"Symplectic integration for the collisional gravitational $N$-body
  problem","We present a new symplectic integrator designed for collisional gravitational
$N$-body problems which makes use of Kepler solvers. The integrator is also
reversible and conserves 9 integrals of motion of the $N$-body problem to
machine precision. The integrator is second order, but the order can easily be
increased by the method of \citeauthor{yos90}. We use fixed time step in all
tests studied in this paper to ensure preservation of symplecticity. We study
small $N$ collisional problems and perform comparisons with typically used
integrators. In particular, we find comparable or better performance when
compared to the 4th order Hermite method and much better performance than
adaptive time step symplectic integrators introduced previously. We find better
performance compared to SAKURA, a non-symplectic, non-time-reversible
integrator based on a different two-body decomposition of the $N$-body problem.
The integrator is a promising tool in collisional gravitational dynamics.",2015-03-09T23:10:13Z
"The small-scale turbulent dynamo in smoothed particle
  magnetohydrodynamics","Supersonic turbulence is believed to be at the heart of star formation. We
have performed smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) simulations of
the small-scale dynamo amplification of magnetic fields in supersonic
turbulence. The calculations use isothermal gas driven at rms velocity of Mach
10 so that conditions are representative of star-forming molecular clouds in
the Milky Way. The growth of magnetic energy is followed for 10 orders in
magnitude until it reaches saturation, a few percent of the kinetic energy. The
results of our dynamo calculations are compared with results from grid-based
methods, finding excellent agreement on their statistics and their qualitative
behaviour. The simulations utilise the latest algorithmic developments we have
developed, in particular, a new divergence cleaning approach to maintain the
solenoidal constraint on the magnetic field and a method to reduce the
numerical dissipation of the magnetic shock capturing scheme. We demonstrate
that our divergence cleaning method may be used to achieve $\nabla \cdot {\bf
B}=0$ to machine precision, albeit at significant computational expense.",2016-06-02T17:05:14Z
"Hybrid Adaptive Ray-Moment Method (HARM$^2$): A Highly Parallel Method
  for Radiation Hydrodynamics on Adaptive Grids","We present a highly-parallel multi-frequency hybrid radiation hydrodynamics
algorithm that combines a spatially-adaptive long characteristics method for
the radiation field from point sources with a moment method that handles the
diffuse radiation field produced by a volume-filling fluid. Our Hybrid Adaptive
Ray-Moment Method (HARM$^2$) operates on patch-based adaptive grids, is
compatible with asynchronous time stepping, and works with any moment method.
In comparison to previous long characteristics methods, we have greatly
improved the parallel performance of the adaptive long-characteristics method
by developing a new completely asynchronous and non-blocking communication
algorithm. As a result of this improvement, our implementation achieves
near-perfect scaling up to $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ processors on distributed memory
machines. We present a series of tests to demonstrate the accuracy and
performance of the method.",2016-07-06T20:10:10Z
"Constrained hyperbolic divergence cleaning in smoothed particle
  magnetohydrodynamics with variable cleaning speeds","We present an updated constrained hyperbolic/parabolic divergence cleaning
algorithm for smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) that remains
conservative with wave cleaning speeds which vary in space and time. This is
accomplished by evolving the quantity $\psi / c_h$ instead of $\psi$. Doing so
allows each particle to carry an individual wave cleaning speed, $c_h$, that
can evolve in time without needing an explicit prescription for how it should
evolve, preventing circumstances which we demonstrate could lead to runaway
energy growth related to variable wave cleaning speeds. This modification
requires only a minor adjustment to the cleaning equations and is trivial to
adopt in existing codes. Finally, we demonstrate that our constrained
hyperbolic/parabolic divergence cleaning algorithm, run for a large number of
iterations, can reduce the divergence of the field to an arbitrarily small
value, achieving $\nabla \cdot B=0$ to machine precision.",2016-07-08T14:52:12Z
PHOTOMETRYPIPELINE: An Automated Pipeline for Calibrated Photometry,"PHOTOMETRYPIPELINE (PP) is an automated pipeline that produces calibrated
photometry from imaging data through image registration, aperture photometry,
photometric calibration, and target identification with only minimal human
interaction. PP utilizes the widely used Source Extractor software for source
identification and aperture photometry; SCAMP is used for image registration.
Both image registration and photometric calibration are based on matching field
stars with star catalogs, requiring catalog coverage of the respective field. A
number of different astrometric and photometric catalogs can be queried online.
Relying on a sufficient number of background stars for image registration and
photometric calibration, PP is well-suited to analyze data from small to
medium-sized telescopes. Calibrated magnitudes obtained by PP are typically
accurate within 0.03 mag and astrometric accuracies are of the order of 0.3
arcsec relative to the catalogs used in the registration. The pipeline consists
of an open-source software suite written in Python 2.7, can be run on
Unix-based systems on a simple desktop machine, and is capable of realtime data
analysis. PP has been developed for observations of moving targets, but can be
used for analyzing point source observations of any kind.",2017-02-02T21:34:01Z
Grain growth for astrophysics with Discontinuous Galerkin schemes,"Depending on their sizes, dust grains store more or less charges, catalyse
more or less chemical reactions, intercept more or less photons and stick more
or less efficiently to form embryos of planets. Hence the need for an accurate
treatment of dust coagulation and fragmentation in numerical modelling.
However, existing algorithms for solving the coagulation equation are
over-diffusive in the conditions of 3D simulations. We address this challenge
by developing a high-order solver based on the Discontinuous Galerkin method.
This algorithm conserves mass to machine precision and allows to compute
accurately the growth of dust grains over several orders of magnitude in size
with a very limited number of dust bins.",2020-11-24T19:00:01Z
"Estimating the key parameters of Nova V5668 SGR using the Uniform Slab
  Model","Novae, explosive events in binary star systems involving a white dwarf and a
companion star, offer profound insights into extreme astrophysical conditions.
During the eruption of a nova, material accreted onto the white dwarf's surface
undergoes a thermonuclear runaway reaction resulting in the ejection of matter
into space and the formation of a luminous shell. The classical V5668 Sgr (Nova
Sagittarii) was the second and brighter of the two novae in the southern
constellation of Sagittarius. It was discovered by John Seach of Chatsworth
Island, Australia, on March 15, 2015. In this paper, drawing on data from Karl
G. Jansky Very Large Array, the US-based radio astronomy observatory, on V5668
Sgr as well as from research that aggregates data from a range of sources
including telescope archives, this study used the Uniform Slab Model and
statistical techniques to plot the nova's light and frequency curves and
estimate its ejected shell mass and the brightness temperature. These
characteristics help us better understand the nova's formation and eruption.
The paper presents the light curves in a machine-readable format and provides
insight into the behaviour of ionised gas clouds.",2023-12-28T09:14:33Z
"Astro+: Design, construction, and scientific exploitation of a
  large-scale massive star spectroscopic database","Massive stars condition the evolution of the interstellar medium by the
amount of energy released during their lives and especially by their deaths as
supernova explosions. The vast amounts of spectroscopic data for massive stars
provided by previous and existing instruments on ground-based and space-based
telescopes have already saturated our capability to process them by the use of
human routines. As a consequence, there is a pressing need for machine-assisted
tools to help handle incoming data. To this end, we present the development of
a massive star spectroscopic multiwavelength interactive database designed for
scientific research and a fully automatic stellar parameter determination tool.
Here we show the preliminary results of the application of these tools to
optical spectra of O-type stars.",2024-01-10T14:44:29Z
"Local Spherical Collapsing Box in Athena++: Numerical Implementation and
  Benchmark Tests","We implement a local model for a spherical collapsing/expanding gas cloud
into the Athena++ magnetohydrodynamic code. This local model consists of a
Cartesian periodic box with time-dependent geometry. We present a series of
benchmark test problems, including non-linear solutions and linear
perturbations of the local model, confirming the code's desired performance.
During a spherical collapse, a horizontal shear flow is amplified,
corresponding to angular momentum conservation of zonal flows in the global
problem; wave speed and amplitude of sound waves increase in the local frame,
due to the reduction in the characteristic length scale of the box, which can
lead to an anisotropic effective sound speed in the local box. Our code
conserves both mass and momentum to machine precision. This numerical
implementation of the local model has potential applications to the study of
local physics and hydrodynamic instabilities during protostellar collapse,
providing a powerful framework for better understanding the earliest stages of
star and planet formation.",2024-06-25T14:27:38Z
"Merging of Components in Close Binaries: Type Ia Supernovae, Massive
  White Dwarfs, and Ap stars","The ""Scenario Machine"" (a computer code designed for studies of the evolution
of close binaries) was used to carry out a population synthesis for a wide
range of merging astrophysical objects: main-sequence stars with main-sequence
stars; white dwarfs with white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes; neutron
stars with neutron stars and black holes; and black holes with black holes.We
calculate the rates of such events, and plot the mass distributions for merging
white dwarfs and main-sequence stars. It is shown that Type Ia supernovae can
be used as standard candles only after approximately one billion years of
evolution of galaxies. In the course of this evolution, the average energy of
Type Ia supernovae should decrease by roughly 10%; the maximum and minimum
energies of Type Ia supernovae may differ by no less than by a factor of 1.5.
This circumstance should be taken into account in estimations of parameters of
acceleration of the Universe. According to theoretical estimates, the most
massive - as a rule, magnetic - white dwarfs probably originate from mergers of
white dwarfs of lower mass. At least some magnetic Ap and Bp stars may form in
mergers of low-mass main sequence stars (<1.5 mass of the Sun) with convective
envelopes.",2009-01-30T15:06:34Z
"A Probabilistic Approach to Fitting Period-Luminosity Relations and
  Validating Gaia Parallaxes","Pulsating stars, such as Cepheids, Miras, and RR Lyrae stars, are important
distance indicators and calibrators of the ""cosmic distance ladder"", and yet
their period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relations are still constrained using
simple statistical methods that cannot take full advantage of available data.
To enable optimal usage of data provided by the Gaia mission, we present a
probabilistic approach that simultaneously constrains parameters of PLZ
relations and uncertainties in Gaia parallax measurements. We demonstrate this
approach by constraining PLZ relations of type $ab$ RR Lyrae stars in
near-infrared W1 and W2 bands, using Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS)
parallax measurements for a sample of $\approx100$ type $ab$ RR Lyrae stars
located within 2.5 kpc of the Sun. The fitted PLZ relations are consistent with
previous studies, and in combination with other data, deliver distances precise
to 6% (once various sources of uncertainty are taken into account). To a
precision of 0.05 mas ($1\sigma$), we do not find a statistically significant
offset in TGAS parallaxes for this sample of distant RR Lyrae stars (median
parallax of 0.8 mas and distance of 1.4 kpc). With only minor modifications,
our probabilistic approach can be used to constrain PLZ relations of other
pulsating stars, and we intend to apply it to Cepheid and Mira stars in the
near future.",2016-11-21T21:00:04Z
"A survey for planetary-mass brown dwarfs in the Chamaeleon I
  star-forming region","We have performed a search for planetary-mass brown dwarfs in the Chamaeleon
I star-forming region using proper motions and photometry measured from optical
and infrared images from the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Hubble Space
Telescope, and ground-based facilities. Through near-infrared spectroscopy at
Gemini Observatory, we have confirmed six of the candidates as new late-type
members of Chamaeleon I >M7.75. One of these objects, Cha J11110675-7636030,
has the faintest extinction-corrected M_K among known members, which
corresponds to a mass of 3-6 M_Jup according to evolutionary models. That
object and two other new members have redder mid-IR colors than young
photospheres at <M9.5, which may indicate the presence of disks. However, since
those objects may be later than M9.5 and the mid-IR colors of young
photospheres are ill-defined at those types, we cannot determine conclusively
whether color excesses from disks are present. If Cha J11110675-7636030 does
have a disk, it would be a contender for the least-massive known brown dwarf
with a disk. Since the new brown dwarfs that we have found extend below our
completeness limit of 6-10 M_Jup, deeper observations are needed to measure the
minimum mass of the initial mass function in Chamaeleon I.",2017-05-31T19:32:46Z
"A Survey For Planetary-mass Brown Dwarfs in the Taurus and Perseus
  Star-forming Regions","We present the initial results from a survey for planetary-mass brown dwarfs
in the Taurus star-forming region. We have identified brown dwarf candidates in
Taurus using proper motions and photometry from several ground- and space-based
facilities. Through spectroscopy of some of the more promising candidates, we
have found 18 new members of Taurus. They have spectral types ranging from mid
M to early L and they include the four faintest known members in
extinction-corrected K_s, which should have masses as low as ~4-5 M_Jup
according to evolutionary models. Two of the coolest new members (M9.25, M9.5)
have mid-IR excesses that indicate the presence of disks. Two fainter objects
with types of M9-L2 and M9-L3 also have red mid-IR colors relative to
photospheres at <=L0, but since the photospheric colors are poorly defined at
>L0, it is unclear whether they have excesses from disks. We also have obtained
spectra of candidate members of the IC 348 and NGC 1333 clusters in Perseus
that were identified by Luhman et al. (2016). Eight candidates are found to be
probable members, three of which are among the faintest and least-massive known
members of the clusters (~5 M_Jup).",2017-09-06T22:23:12Z
"Searching For Transiting Planets Around Halo Stars. I. Sample Selection
  and Validation","By measuring the elemental abundances of a star, we can gain insight into the
composition of its initial gas cloud -- the formation site of the star and its
planets. Planet formation requires metals, the availability of which is
determined by the elemental abundance. In the case where metals are extremely
deficient, planet formation can be stifled. To investigate such a scenario
requires a large sample of metal-poor stars and a search for planets therein.
This paper focuses on the selection and validation of a halo star sample. We
select ~17,000 metal-poor halo stars based on their Galactic kinematics, and
confirm their low metallicities ([Fe/H] < -0.5), using spectroscopy from the
literature. Furthermore, we perform high-resolution spectroscopic observations
using LBT/PEPSI and conduct detailed metallicity ([Fe/H]) analyses on a sample
of 13 previously known halo stars that also have hot kinematics. We can use the
halo star sample presented here to measure the frequency of planets and to test
planet formation in extremely metal-poor environments. The result of the planet
search and its implications will be presented and discussed in a companion
paper by Boley et al.",2021-06-24T18:00:06Z
"A well-balanced scheme for the simulation tool-kit A-MaZe:
  implementation, tests, and first applications to stellar structure","Characterizing stellar convection in multiple dimensions is a topic at the
forefront of stellar astrophysics. Numerical simulations are an essential tool
for this task. We present an extension of the existing numerical tool-kit
A-MaZe that enables such simulations of stratified flows in a gravitational
field. The finite-volume based, cell-centered, and time-explicit hydrodynamics
solver of A-MaZe was extended such that the scheme is now well-balanced in both
momentum and energy. The algorithm maintains an initially static balance
between gravity and pressure to machine precision. Quasi-stationary convection
in slab-geometry preserves gas energy (internal plus kinetic) on average
despite strong local up- and down-drafts. By contrast, a more standard
numerical scheme is demonstrated to result in substantial gains of energy
within a short time on purely numerical grounds. The test is further used to
point out the role of dimensionality, viscosity, and Rayleigh number for
compressible convection. Applications to a young sun in 2D and 3D, covering a
part of the inner radiative zone as well as the outer convective zone,
demonstrate that the scheme meets its initial design goal. Comparison with
results obtained for a physically identical setup with a time-implicit code
show qualitative agreement.",2019-09-05T14:09:36Z
"An X-ray View of Two Infrared Dark Clouds G034.43+00.24 and
  G035.39-00.33","We present a high spatial resolution Chandra X-ray study of two Infrared Dark
Clouds (IRDCs), G034.43+00.24 and G035.39-00.33, which are expected to be in
the early phases of star cluster formation. We detect 112 and 209 valid X-ray
point sources towards G034.43+00.24 and G035.39-00.33, respectively. We
cross-match the X-ray point sources with 2MASS, GLIMPSE and WISE catalogs and
find 53% and 59% of the X-ray sources in G034.43+00.24 and in G035.39-00.33
have corresponding infrared counterparts, respectively. These sources are
probable members of young massive clusters in formation, and using stellar
isochrones we estimate that a population of 1--2 Myr old, intermediate to high
mass young stellar objects (YSOs) exist in both IRDCs. Two and ten Class II
counterparts to X-ray sources were identified in G034.43+00.24 and in
G035.39-00.33, respectively, which are located in or near dark filaments. The
X-ray Luminosity Function (XLF) of G035.39-00.33 implies that the total mass
consists of up to $\sim1,700\:M_\odot$ of stars, using the XLF of the
well-studied Orion Nebula Cluster as calibrator. This corresponds to a star
formation efficiency of at most 5%, indicating the system is still very much
gas dominated and in an early stage of the star formation process. The
population of G034.43+00.24 is less well determined due to the lower
sensitivity of its observations.",2020-10-17T14:01:18Z
Stellar parametrization of LAMOST M dwarf stars,"M dwarf stars are the most common stars in the Galaxy, dominating the
population of the Galaxy by numbers at faint magnitudes. Precise and accurate
stellar parameters for M dwarfs are of crucial importance for many studies.
However, the atmospheric parameters of M dwarf stars are difficult to be
determined. In this paper, we present a catalog of the spectroscopic stellar
parameters ($T_{eff}$ and [M/H]) of $\sim$ 300,000 M dwarf stars observed by
both LAMOST and Gaia using Stellar Label Machine (SLAM). We train a SLAM model
using LAMOST spectra with APOGEE Data Release 16 (DR16) labels with $2800 \lt
T_{eff} \lt 4500$K and $-2 \lt [M/H] \lt 0.5$ dex. The SLAM $T_{eff}$ is in
agreement to within $\sim 50$K compared to the previous study determined by
APOGEE observation, and SLAM [M/H] agree within 0.12 dex compared to the APOGEE
observation. We also set up a SLAM model trained by BT-Settl atmospheric model,
with random uncertainties (in cross-validation) to 60K and agree within $\sim
90$K compared to previous study.",2020-12-28T03:46:39Z

the unique algorithms AR-Radau, AR-Sym6, AR-ABITS and AR-chain$^+$ which we
show out-perform other methods in the literature and allow for fast, precise
and accurate computations to deal with few-body problems ranging from
interacting black holes to planetary dynamics. We show that AR-Sym6 and
AR-chain$^+$, with algorithmic regularization, chain algorithm, active
round-off error compensation and a symplectic kernel implementation, are the
fastest and most accurate algorithms to treat black hole dynamics with extreme
mass ratios, extreme eccentricities and very close encounters. AR-Radau, the
first regularized Radau integrator with round off error control down to 64 bits
floating point machine precision, has the ability to handle extremely eccentric
orbits and close approaches in long-term integrations. AR-ABITS, a bit
efficient arbitrary precision method, achieves any precision with the least CPU
cost compared to other open source arbitrary precision few-body codes. With the
implementation of deep numerical and code optimization, these new algorithms in
{\tt SpaceHub} prove superior to other popular high precision few-body codes in
terms of performance, accuracy and speed.",2021-04-13T18:00:00Z
The mercurial Sun at the heart of our solar system,"As the powerhouse of our solar system, the Sun's electromagnetic planetary
influences appear contradictory. On the one hand, the Sun for aeons emitted
radiation which was ""just right"" for life to evolve in our terrestrial
Goldilocks zone, even for such complex organisms as ourselves. On the other, in
the dawn of Earth's existence the Sun was far dimmer than today, and yet
evidence for early liquid water is written into geology. Now in middle age, the
Sun should be a benign object of little interest to society or even
astronomers. However, for physical reasons yet to be fully understood, it
contains a magnetic machine with a slightly arrhythmic 11 year magnetic
heartbeat. Although these variations require merely
  0.1% of the solar luminosity, this power floods the solar system with rapidly
changing fluxes of photons and particles at energies far above the 0.5eV
thermal energy characteristic of the photosphere. Ejected solar plasma carries
magnetic fields into space with consequences for planets, the Earth being
vulnerable to geomagnetic storms.
  This chapter discusses some physical reasons why the Sun suffers from such
ailments, and examine consequences through time across the solar system. A
Leitmotiv of the discussion is that any rotating and convecting star must
inevitably generate magnetic ""activity"" for which the Sun represents the
example par excellence.",2022-05-06T23:08:02Z
"Energy conserving and well-balanced discontinuous Galerkin methods for
  the Euler-Poisson equations in spherical symmetry","This paper presents high-order Runge-Kutta (RK) discontinuous Galerkin
methods for the Euler-Poisson equations in spherical symmetry. The scheme can
preserve a general polytropic equilibrium state and achieve total energy
conservation up to machine precision with carefully designed spatial and
temporal discretizations. To achieve the well-balanced property, the numerical
solutions are decomposed into equilibrium and fluctuation components which are
treated differently in the source term approximation. One non-trivial challenge
encountered in the procedure is the complexity of the equilibrium state, which
is governed by the Lane-Emden equation. For total energy conservation, we
present second- and third-order RK time discretization, where different source
term approximations are introduced in each stage of the RK method to ensure the
conservation of total energy. A carefully designed slope limiter for spherical
symmetry is also introduced to eliminate oscillations near discontinuities
while maintaining the well-balanced and total-energy-conserving properties.
Extensive numerical examples -- including a toy model of stellar core-collapse
with a phenomenological equation of state that results in core-bounce and shock
formation -- are provided to demonstrate the desired properties of the proposed
methods, including the well-balanced property, high-order accuracy, shock
capturing capability, and total energy conservation.",2022-05-09T17:51:44Z
"Astrophysical properties of 600 bonafide single stars in the Hyades open
  cluster","The determination of the astrophysical properties of stars remains
challenging, and frequently relies on the application of stellar models.
Stellar sequences in nearby open clusters provide some of the best means to
test and calibrate stellar evolutionary models and isochrones, and to use these
models to assign astrophysical properties consistently to a large sample of
stars. We aim at updating the single star sequence of members of the Hyades
cluster, identifying the best-fitting isochrones, and determining the
astrophysical properties of the stars. The Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars
provides a comprehensive sample of high-probability members of the Hyades
cluster. We apply a multi-step method to flag photometric outliers, and to
identify bonafide single stars and likely binary and multiple systems. The
single stars define a tight sequence, which in the mass range 0.12 to 2.2 Msun
is well-fitted by PARSEC isochrones for a supersolar metallicity of [M/H] =
+0.18 +- 0.03 and an age of 775 +- 25 Myr. The isochrones enable us to assign
mass, effective temperature, luminosity, and surface gravity to each of the 600
bonafide single main-sequence stars. The observed sequence validates the PARSEC
isochrones. The derived stellar properties can serve as benchmarks for
atmospheric and evolutionary models, and for all-sky catalogs of stellar
astrophysical properties. The stellar properties are also relevant for studies
of exoplanet properties among Hyades exoplanet hosts.",2023-01-10T19:00:02Z
"Atomic Transition Probabilities for Transitions of Si I and Si II and
  the Silicon Abundances of Several Very Metal-Poor Stars","We report new measurements of branching fractions for 20 UV and blue lines in
the spectrum of neutral silicon (Si I) originating in the 3$s^{2}$3$p$4$s$
$^{3}$P$^{\rm o}_{1,2}$, $^{1}$P$^{\rm o}_{1}$ and 3$s$3$p^{3}$ $^{1}$D$^{\rm
o}_{1,2}$ upper levels. Transitions studied include both strong, nearly pure LS
multiplets as well as very weak spin-forbidden transitions connected to these
upper levels. We also report a new branching fraction measurement of the
$^{4}$P$_{1/2}$ - $^{2}$P$^{\rm o}_{1/2,3/2}$ intercombination lines in the
spectrum of singly-ionized silicon (Si II). The weak spin-forbidden lines of Si
I and Si II provide a stringent test on recent theoretical calculations, to
which we make comparison. The branching fractions from this study are combined
with previously reported radiative lifetimes to yield transition probabilities
and log($gf$)s for these lines. We apply these new measurements to abundance
determinations in five metal-poor stars.",2023-01-26T20:12:57Z
"The HARPS-TERRA project I. Description of the algorithms, performance
  and new measurements on a few remarkable stars observed by HARPS","Doppler spectroscopy has uncovered or confirmed all the known planets
orbiting nearby stars. Two main techniques are used to obtain precision Doppler
measurements at optical wavelengths. The first approach is the gas cell method,
which consists on the least-squares matching of the spectrum of Iodine
imprinted on the spectrum of the star. The second method relies on the
construction of a stabilized spectrograph externally calibrated in wavelength.
The most precise stabilized spectrometer in operation is HARPS, operated by ESO
in La Silla Observatory/Chile. The Doppler measurements obtained with HARPS are
typically obtained using the Cross-Correlation Function technique (CCF). It
consists of multiplying the stellar spectrum with a weighted binary mask and
finding the minimum of such product as a function of the Doppler shift. It is
known that CCF is suboptimal in exploiting the Doppler information in the
stellar spectrum. Here, we describe an algorithm to obtain precision RV
measurements using least-squares matching of each observed spectrum to a high
signal-to-noise ratio template derived from the same observations. Such
algorithm is implemented in our software called HARPS-TERRA (Template Enhanced
Radial velocity Re-analysis Application). New radial velocity measurements on a
representative sample of stars observed by HARPS is used to illustrate the
benefits of the proposed method. We show that, compared to CCF, template
matching provides a significant improvement in accuracy, specially when applied
to M dwarfs.",2012-02-12T20:54:15Z
Half-Skyrmions and the Equation of State for Compact-Star Matter,"The half-skyrmions that appear in dense baryonic matter when skyrmions are
put on crystals modify drastically hadron properties in dense medium and affect
strongly the nuclear tensor forces, thereby influencing the equation of state
(EoS) of dense nuclear and asymmetric nuclear matter. The matter comprised of
half skyrmions has vanishing quark condensate but non-vanishing pion decay
constant and could be interpreted as a hadronic dual of strong-coupled quark
matter. We infer from this observation combined with certain predictions of
hidden local symmetry in low-energy hadronic interactionsa a set of new scaling
laws -- called ""new-BR"" -- for the parameters in nuclear effective field theory
controlled by renormalization-group flow. They are subjected to the EoS of
symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter, and are then applied to nuclear
symmetry energies and properties of compact stars. The changeover from the
skyrmion matter to a half-skyrmion matter that takes place after the cross-over
density $n_{1/2}$ provides a simple and natural field theoretic explanation for
the change of the EoS from soft to stiff at a density above that of nuclear
matter required for compact stars as massive as $\sim 2.4M_\odot$. Cross-over
density in the range $1.5n_0 \lsim n_{1/2} \lsim 2.0 n_0$ has been employed,
and the possible skyrmion half-skyrmion coexistence {or cross-over} near
$n_{1/2}$ is discussed. The novel structure of {the tensor forces and} the EoS
obtained with the new-BR scaling is relevant for neutron-rich nuclei and
compact star matter and could be studied in RIB (rare isotope beam) machines.",2012-07-02T15:50:08Z
An ALMA Survey of Protoplanetary Disks in the $σ$ Orionis Cluster,"The $\sigma$ Orionis cluster is important for studying protoplanetary disk
evolution, as its intermediate age ($\sim$3-5 Myr) is comparable to the median
disk lifetime. We use ALMA to conduct a high-sensitivity survey of dust and gas
in 92 protoplanetary disks around $\sigma$ Orionis members with
$M_{\ast}\gtrsim0.1 M_{\odot}$. Our observations cover the 1.33 mm continuum
and several CO $J=2-1$ lines: out of 92 sources, we detect 37 in the mm
continuum and six in $^{12}$CO, three in $^{13}$CO, and none in C$^{18}$O.
Using the continuum emission to estimate dust mass, we find only 11 disks with
$M_{\rm dust}\gtrsim10 M_{\oplus}$, indicating that after only a few Myr of
evolution most disks lack sufficient dust to form giant planet cores. Stacking
the individually undetected continuum sources limits their average dust mass to
5$\times$ lower than that of the faintest detected disk, supporting theoretical
models that indicate rapid dissipation once disk clearing begins. Comparing the
protoplanetary disk population in $\sigma$ Orionis to those of other
star-forming regions supports the steady decline in average dust mass and the
steepening of the $M_{\rm dust}$-$M_{\ast}$ relation with age; studying these
evolutionary trends can inform the relative importance of different disk
processes during key eras of planet formation. External photoevaporation from
the central O9 star is influencing disk evolution throughout the region: dust
masses clearly decline with decreasing separation from the photoionizing
source, and the handful of CO detections exist at projected separations $>1.5$
pc. Collectively, our findings indicate that giant planet formation is
inherently rare and/or well underway by a few Myr of age.",2017-03-24T18:00:00Z
"The Pan-STARRS1 Proper-motion Survey for Young Brown Dwarfs in Nearby
  Star-forming Regions. I. Taurus Discoveries and a Reddening-free
  Classification Method for Ultracool Dwarfs","We are conducting a proper-motion survey for young brown dwarfs in the
Taurus-Auriga molecular cloud based on the Pan-STARRS1 3$\pi$ Survey. Our
search uses multi-band photometry and astrometry to select candidates, and is
wider (370 deg$^{2}$) and deeper (down to $\approx$3 M$_{\rm Jup}$) than
previous searches. We present here our search methods and spectroscopic
follow-up of our high-priority candidates. Since extinction complicates
spectral classification, we have developed a new approach using low-resolution
($R \approx 100$) near-infrared spectra to quantify reddening-free spectral
types, extinctions, and gravity classifications for mid-M to late-L ultracool
dwarfs ($\approx 100-3$ M$_{\rm Jup}$ in Taurus). We have discovered 25
low-gravity (VL-G) and the first 11 intermediate-gravity (INT-G) substellar
(M6-L1) members of Taurus, constituting the largest single increase of Taurus
brown dwarfs to date. We have also discovered 1 new Pleiades member and 13 new
members of the Perseus OB2 association, including a candidate very wide
separation (58 kAU) binary. We homogeneously reclassify the spectral types and
extinctions of all previously known Taurus brown dwarfs. Altogether our
discoveries have thus far increased the substellar census in Taurus by $\approx
40\%$ and added three more L-type members ($\approx 5-10$ M$_{\rm Jup}$). Most
notably, our discoveries reveal an older ($>$10 Myr) low-mass population in
Taurus, in accord with recent studies of the higher-mass stellar members. The
mass function appears to differ between the younger and older Taurus
populations, possibly due to incompleteness of the older stellar members or
different star formation processes.",2018-04-04T18:00:01Z
"ALMA observations of polarization from dust scattering in the IM Lup
  protoplanetary disk","We present 870 $\mu$m ALMA observations of polarized dust emission toward the
Class II protoplanetary disk IM Lup. We find that the orientation of the
polarized emission is along the minor axis of the disk, and that the value of
the polarization fraction increases steadily toward the center of the disk,
reaching a peak value of ~1.1%. All of these characteristics are consistent
with models of self-scattering of submillimeter-wave emission from an optically
thin inclined disk. The distribution of the polarization position angles across
the disk reveals that while the average orientation is along the minor axis,
the polarization orientations show a significant spread in angles; this can
also be explained by models of pure scattering. We compare the polarization
with that of the Class I/II source HL Tau. A comparison of cuts of the
polarization fraction across the major and minor axes of both sources reveals
that IM Lup has a substantially higher polarization fraction than HL Tau toward
the center of the disk. This enhanced polarization fraction could be due a
number of factors, including higher optical depth in HL Tau, or scattering by
larger dust grains in the more evolved IM Lup disk. However, models yield
similar maximum grain sizes for both HL Tau (72 $\mu$m) and IM Lup (61 $\mu$m,
this work). This reveals continued tension between grain-size estimates from
scattering models and from models of the dust emission spectrum, which find
that the bulk of the (unpolarized) emission in disks is most likely due to
millimeter (or even centimeter) sized grains.",2018-04-17T14:07:59Z
"Semi-conservative reduced speed of sound technique for low Mach number
  flows with large density variations","The reduced speed of sound technique (RSST) has been used for efficient
simulation of low Mach number flows in solar and stellar convection zones. The
basic RSST equations are hyperbolic, and are suitable for parallel computation
by domain decomposition. The application of RSST is limited to cases where
density perturbations are much smaller than the background density. In
addition, non-conservative variables are required to be evolved using this
method, which is not suitable in cases where discontinuities like shock waves
co-exist in a single numerical domain. In this study, we suggest a new
semi-conservative formulation of the RSST that can be applied to low Mach
number flows with large density variations. We derive the wave speed of the
original and newly suggested methods to clarify that these methods can reduce
the speed of sound without affecting the entropy wave. The equations are
implemented using the finite volume method. Several numerical tests are carried
out to verify the suggested methods. The analysis and numerical results show
that the original RSST is not applicable when mass density variations are
large. In contrast, the newly suggested methods are found to be efficient in
such cases. We also suggest variants of the RSST that conserve momentum in the
machine precision. The newly suggested variants are formulated as
semi-conservative equations, which reduce to the conservative form of the Euler
equations when the speed of sound is not reduced. This property is advantageous
when both high and low Mach number regions are included in the numerical
domain. The newly suggested forms of RSST can be applied to a wider range of
low Mach number flows.",2018-12-10T22:31:36Z
An Open Catalog for Supernova Data,"We present the Open Supernova Catalog, an online collection of observations
and metadata for presently 36,000+ supernovae and related candidates. The
catalog is freely available on the web (https://sne.space), with its main
interface having been designed to be a user-friendly, rapidly-searchable table
accessible on desktop and mobile devices. In addition to the primary catalog
table containing supernova metadata, an individual page is generated for each
supernova which displays its available metadata, light curves, and spectra
spanning X-ray to radio frequencies. The data presented in the catalog is
automatically rebuilt on a daily basis and is constructed by parsing several
dozen sources, including the data presented in the supernova literature and
from secondary sources such as other web-based catalogs. Individual supernova
data is stored in the hierarchical, human- and machine-readable JSON format,
with the entirety of each supernova's data being contained within a single JSON
file bearing its name. The setup we present here, which is based upon open
source software maintained via git repositories hosted on github, enables
anyone to download the entirety of the supernova dataset to their home computer
in minutes, and to make contributions of their own data back to the catalog via
git. As the supernova dataset continues to grow, especially in the upcoming era
of all-sky synoptic telescopes which will increase the total number of events
by orders of magnitude, we hope that the catalog we have designed will be a
valuable tool for the community to analyze both historical and contemporary
supernovae.",2016-05-03T20:00:00Z
"20 years of photometric microlensing events predicted by Gaia DR2:
  Potential planet-hosting lenses within 100 pc","Context. Gaia DR2 offers unparalleled precision on stars' parallaxes and
proper motions. This allows the prediction of microlensing events for which the
lens stars (and any planets they possess) are nearby and may be well studied
and characterised. Aims. We identify a number of potential microlensing events
that will occur before the year 2035.5, 20 years from the Gaia DR2 reference
epoch. Methods. We query Gaia DR2 for potential lenses within 100 pc, extract
parallaxes and proper motions of the lenses and background sources, and
identify potential lensing events. We estimate the lens masses from Priam
effective temperatures, and use these to calculate peak magnifications and the
size of the Einstein radii relative to the lens stars' habitable zones.
Results. We identify 7 future events with a probability > 10% of an alignment
within one Einstein radius. Of particular interest is DR2 5918299904067162240
(WISE J175839.20-583931.6), magnitude G = 14.9, which will lens a G = 13.9
background star in early 2030, with a median 23% net magnification. Other pairs
are typically fainter, hampering characterisation of the lens (if the lens is
faint) or the ability to accurately measure the magnification (if the source is
much fainter than the lens). Of timely interest is DR2 4116504399886241792
(2MASS J17392440-2327071), which will lens a background star in July 2020,
albeit with weak net magnification (0.03%). Median magnifications for the other
5 high-probability events range from 0.3% to 5.3%. The Einstein radii for these
lenses are 1-10 times the radius of the habitable zone, allowing these lensing
events to pick out cold planets around the ice line, and filling a gap between
transit and current microlensing detections of planets around very low-mass
stars. Conclusions. We provide a catalogue of the predicted events to aid
future characterisation efforts... [abridged]",2018-05-29T18:27:14Z
"The young massive star cluster Westerlund 2 observed with MUSE. II.
  MUSEpack -- a Python package to analyze the kinematics of young star clusters","We mapped the Galactic young massive star cluster Westerlund 2 (Wd2) with the
integral field spectrograph MUSE (spatial resolution: 0.2arcsec/px, spectral
resolution: $\Delta \lambda$ = 1.25A, wavelength range 4600-9350A) mounted on
the VLT, as part of an on-going study to measure the stellar and gas kinematics
of the cluster region. In this paper we present the fully reduced dataset and
introduce our new Python package ""MUSEpack"", which we developed to measure
stellar radial velocities with an absolute precision of 1-2km/s without the
necessity of a spectral template library. This novel method uses the
two-dimensional spectra and an atomic transition line library to create
templates around strong absorption lines for each individual star. The code
runs fully automatically on multi-core machines, which makes it possible to
efficiently determine stellar radial velocities of a large number of stars with
the necessary precision to measure the velocity dispersion of young star
clusters. MUSEpack also provides an enhanced method for removing telluric lines
in crowded fields without sky exposures and a Python wrapper for ESO's data
reduction pipeline. We observed Wd2 with a total of 11 short and 5 long
exposures to cover the bright nebular emission and OB stars, as well as the
fainter pre-main sequence stars down to ~1M$_\odot$. The survey covers an area
of ~11arcmin$^2$ (15.8pc$^2$). In total, we extracted 1,725 stellar spectra
with a mean S/N>5 per pixel. A typical radial velocity (RV) uncertainty of
4.78km/s, 2.92km/s, and 1.1km/s is reached for stars with a mean S/N>10,
S/N>20, S/N>50 per pixel, respectively. Depending on the number of spectral
lines used to measure the RVs, it is possible to reach RV accuracies of
0.9km/s, 1.3km/s, and 2.2km/s with $\geq5$, 3-4, and 1-2 spectral lines,
respectively. The combined statistical uncertainty on the radial velocity
measurements is 1.10km/s.",2019-09-17T23:32:29Z
"The first ALMA survey of protoplanetary discs at 3 mm: demographics of
  grain growth in the Lupus region","We present the first ALMA survey of protoplanetary discs at 3 mm, targeting
36 young stellar objects in the Lupus star-forming region with deep
observations (sensitivity 20-50 microJy/beam) at ~0.35"" resolution (~50 au).
Building on previous ALMA surveys at 0.89 and 1.3 mm that observed the complete
sample of Class II discs in Lupus at a comparable resolution, we aim to assess
the level of grain growth in the relatively young Lupus region. We measure 3 mm
integrated fluxes, from which we derive disc-averaged 1-3 mm spectral indices.
We find that the mean spectral index of the observed Lupus discs is
$\alpha_\mathrm{1-3 mm}=2.23\pm0.06$, in all cases $\alpha_\mathrm{1-3
mm}<3.0$, with a tendency for larger spectral indices in the brightest discs
and in transition discs. Furthermore, we find that the distribution of spectral
indices in Lupus discs is statistically indistinguishable from that of the
Taurus and Ophiuchus star-forming regions. Assuming the emission is optically
thin, the low values $\alpha_\mathrm{1-3 mm}\leq 2.5$ measured for most discs
can be interpreted with the presence of grains larger than 1 mm. The
observations of the faint discs in the sample can be explained without invoking
the presence of large grains, namely through a mixture of optically thin and
optically thick emission from small grains. However, the bright (and typically
large) discs do inescapably require the presence of millimeter-sized grains in
order to have realistic masses. Based on a disc mass argument, our results
challenge previous claims that the presence of optically thick sub-structures
may be a universal explanation for the empirical millimeter size-luminosity
correlation observed at 0.89 mm.",2020-10-05T18:03:23Z
"Metrics of research impact in astronomy: Predicting later impact from
  metrics measured 10-15 years after the PhD","This paper calibrates how metrics derivable from the SAO/NASA Astrophysics
Data System can be used to estimate the future impact of astronomy research
careers and thereby to inform decisions on resource allocation such as job
hires and tenure decisions. Three metrics are used, citations of refereed
papers, citations of all publications normalized by the numbers of co-authors,
and citations of all first-author papers. Each is individually calibrated as an
impact predictor in the book Kormendy (2020), ""Metrics of Research Impact in
Astronomy"" (Astron Soc Pac Conference Series Monograph 8, San Francisco). How
this is done is reviewed in the first half of this paper. Then, I show that
averaging results from three metrics produces more accurate predictions.
Average prediction machines are constructed for different cohorts of 1990-2007
PhDs and used to postdict 2017 impact from metrics measured 10, 12, and 15
years after the PhD. The time span over which prediction is made ranges from 0
years for 2007 PhDs to 17 years for 1990 PhDs using metrics measured 10 years
after the PhD. Calibration is based on perceived 2017 impact as voted by 22
experienced astronomers for 510 faculty members at 17 highly-ranked university
astronomy departments world-wide. Prediction machinery reproduces voted impact
estimates with an RMS uncertainty of 1/8 of the dynamic range for people in the
study sample. The aim of this work is to lend some of the rigor that is
normally used in scientific research to the difficult and subjective job of
judging people's careers.",2021-10-27T01:36:42Z
"A Catalog of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections Observed by Juno
  between 1 and 5.4 AU","We use magnetic field measurements by the Juno spacecraft to catalog and
investigate interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) beyond 1 AU. During
its cruise phase, Juno spent about 5 years in the solar wind between 2011
September and 2016 June, providing measurements of the interplanetary magnetic
field (IMF) between 1 and 5.4 AU. Juno therefore presents the most recent
opportunity for a statistical analysis of ICME properties beyond 1 AU since the
Ulysses mission (1990-2009). Our catalog includes 80 such ICME events, 32 of
which contain associated flux-rope-like structures. We find that the dependency
of the mean magnetic field strength of the magnetic flux ropes decreases with
heliocentric distance as $r^{-1.24 \pm 0.43}$ between 1 and 5.4 AU, in good
agreement with previous relationships calculated using ICME catalogs at
Ulysses. We combine the Juno catalog with the HELCATS catalog to create a
dataset of ICMEs covering 0.3-5.4 AU. Using a linear regression model to fit
the combined dataset on a double-logarithmic plot, we find that there is a
clear difference between global expansion rates for ICMEs observed at lesser
heliocentric distances and those observed farther out beyond 1 AU. The
cataloged ICMEs at Juno present a good basis for future multispacecraft studies
of ICME evolution between the inner heliosphere, 1 AU, and beyond.",2021-11-22T16:40:54Z
"Von Zeipel - Lidov - Kozai cycles in action: $Kepler$ triples with
  eclipse depth variations: KICs 6964043, 5653126, 5731312 and 8023317","We report the results of the photodynamical analyses of four compact, tight
triple stellar systems, KICs 6964043, 5653126, 5731312, 8023317, based largely
on $Kepler$ and $TESS$ data. All systems display remarkable eclipse timing and
eclipse depth variations, the latter implying a non-aligned outer orbit.
Moreover, KIC 6964043 is also a triply eclipsing system. We combined
photometry, ETV curves, and archival spectral energy distribution data to
obtain the astrophysical parameters of the constituent stars and the orbital
elements with substantial precision. KICs 6964043 and 5653126 were found to be
nearly flat with mutual inclinations $i_{mut}=4.1$ deg and $12.3$ deg,
respectively, while KICs 5731312, 8023317 ($i_{mut}=39.4$ deg and $55.7$ deg,
respectively) are found to lie in the high $i_{mut}$ regime of the von
Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov (ZKL) theorem. We show that currently both high inclination
triples exhibit observable unusual retrograde apsidal motion. Moreover, the
eclipses will disappear in all but one of the four systems within a few
decades. Short-term numerical integrations of the dynamical evolution reveal
that both high inclination triples are currently subject to ongoing, large
amplitude ($\Delta e\sim0.3$) inner eccentricity variations on centuries-long
timescales, in accord with the ZKL theorem. Longer-term integrations predict
that two of the four systems may become dynamically unstable on $\sim$ Gyr
timescales, while in the other two triples common envelope phases and stellar
mergers may occur. Finally we investigate the dynamical properties of a sample
of 71 KIC/TIC triples statistically, and find that the mutual inclinations and
outer mass ratios are anti-correlated at the 4$\sigma$ level. We discuss the
implications for the formation mechanisms of compact triples.",2022-07-12T13:21:18Z
"IDEFIX: a versatile performance-portable Godunov code for astrophysical
  flows","Exascale super-computers now becoming available rely on hybrid
energy-efficient architectures that involve an accelerator such as Graphics
Processing Units (GPU). Leveraging the computational power of these machines
often means a significant rewrite of the numerical tools each time a new
architecture becomes available. To address these issues, we present Idefix, a
new code for astrophysical flows that relies on the Kokkos meta-programming
library to guarantee performance portability on a wide variety of architectures
while keeping the code as simple as possible for the user. Idefix is based on a
Godunov finite-volume method that solves the non-relativistic HD and MHD
equations on various grid geometries. Idefix includes a wide choice of solvers
and several additional modules (constrained transport, orbital advection,
non-ideal MHD) allowing users to address complex astrophysical problems. Idefix
has been successfully tested on Intel and AMD CPUs (up to 131 072 CPU cores on
Irene-Rome at TGCC) as well as NVidia and AMD GPUs (up to 1024 GPUs on Adastra
at CINES). Idefix achieves more than 1e8 cell/s in MHD on a single NVidia V100
GPU and 3e11 cell/s on 256 Adastra nodes (1024 GPUs) with 95% parallelization
efficiency (compared to a single node). For the same problem, Idefix is up to 6
times more energy efficient on GPUs compared to Intel Cascade Lake CPUs. Idefix

variety of astrophysical and fluid dynamics applications.",2023-04-26T18:00:01Z
The ChromaStar+ modelling suite and the VALD line list,"We present Version 2023-02-04 (ISO) of the Chroma+ atmospheric, spectrum, and
transit light-curve modelling suite, which incorporates the VALD atomic line
list. This is a major improvement as the previous versions used the much
smaller NIST line list. The NIST line list is still available in Chroma+ for
those projects requiring speed over completeness of line opacity. We describe a
procedure for exploiting the ''Array job'' capability of the slurm workload
manager on multi-cpu machines to compute broadband high resolution spectra with
the VALD line list quickly using the Java version of the code (ChromaStarServer
(CSS)). The inclusion of a much larger line list more completely allows for the
many weaker lines that over-blanket the blue band in late-type stars and has
allowed us to reduce the amount of additional ad hoc continuous opacity needed
to fit the solar spectral energy distribution (SED). The additional line
opacity exposed a subtle bug in the spectrum synthesis procedure that was
causing residual blue line wing opacity to accumulate at shorter wavelengths.
We present our latest fits to the observed solar SED and to the observed
rectified high resolution visible band spectra of the Sun and the standard
stars Arcturus and Vega. We also introduce the fully automated Burke-Gaffney
Observatory (BGO) at Saint Mary's University (SMU) and compare our synthetic
spectra to low resolution spectra obtained with our grism spectrograph that is
available to students. The fully automated BGO, the spectrograph, and the BGO
spectrum reduction procedure are fully described in a companion paper. All
codes are available from the OpenStars www site: www.ap.smu.ca/OpenStars.",2023-07-03T18:08:30Z
"When Do Stalled Stars Resume Spinning Down? Advancing Gyrochronology
  with Ruprecht 147","Recent measurements of rotation periods ($P_\text{rot}$) in the benchmark
open clusters Praesepe (670 Myr), NGC 6811 (1 Gyr), and NGC 752 (1.4 Gyr)
demonstrate that, after converging onto a tight sequence of slowly rotating
stars in mass$-$period space, stars temporarily stop spinning down. These data
also show that the duration of this epoch of stalled spin-down increases toward
lower masses. To determine when stalled stars resume spinning down, we use data
from the $K2$ mission and the Palomar Transient Factory to measure
$P_\text{rot}$ for 58 dwarf members of the 2.7-Gyr-old cluster Ruprecht 147, 39
of which satisfy our criteria designed to remove short-period or
near-equal-mass binaries. Combined with the $Kepler$ $P_\text{rot}$ data for
the approximately coeval cluster NGC 6819 (30 stars with $M_\star > 0.85$
M$_\odot$), our new measurements more than double the number of $\approx$2.5
Gyr benchmark rotators and extend this sample down to $\approx$0.55 M$_\odot$.
The slowly rotating sequence for this joint sample appears relatively flat (22
$\pm$ 2 days) compared to sequences for younger clusters. This sequence also
intersects the $Kepler$ intermediate period gap, demonstrating that this gap
was not created by a lull in star formation. We calculate the time at which
stars resume spinning down, and find that 0.55 M$_\odot$ stars remain stalled
for at least 1.3 Gyr. To accurately age-date low-mass stars in the field,
gyrochronology formulae must be modified to account for this stalling
timescale. Empirically tuning a core$-$envelope coupling model with open
cluster data can account for most of the apparent stalling effect. However,
alternative explanations, e.g., a temporary reduction in the magnetic braking
torque, cannot yet be ruled out.",2020-10-05T18:31:25Z
"Staring at the Sun with the Keck Planet Finder: An Autonomous Solar
  Calibrator for High Signal-to-Noise Sun-as-a-Star Spectra","Extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) measurements contend with internal
noise (instrumental systematics) and external noise (intrinsic stellar
variability) on the road to 10 cm/s ""exo-Earth"" sensitivity. Both of these
noise sources are well-probed using ""Sun-as-a-star"" RVs and cross-instrument
comparisons. We built the Solar Calibrator (SoCal), an autonomous system that
feeds stable, disc-integrated sunlight to the recently commissioned Keck Planet
Finder (KPF) at the W. M. Keck Observatory. With SoCal, KPF acquires
signal-to-noise ~1200, R = ~98,000 optical (445--870 nm) spectra of the Sun in
5~sec exposures at unprecedented cadence for an EPRV facility using KPF's fast
readout mode (<16 sec between exposures). Daily autonomous operation is
achieved by defining an operations loop using state machine logic. Data
affected by clouds are automatically flagged using a reliable quality control
metric derived from simultaneous irradiance measurements. Comparing solar data
across the growing global network of EPRV spectrographs with solar feeds will
allow EPRV teams to disentangle internal and external noise sources and
benchmark spectrograph performance. To facilitate this, all SoCal data products
are immediately available to the public on the Keck Observatory Archive. We
compared SoCal RVs to contemporaneous RVs from NEID, the only other immediately
public EPRV solar dataset. We find agreement at the 30-40 cm/s level on
timescales of several hours, which is comparable to the combined photon-limited
precision. Data from SoCal were also used to assess a detector problem and
wavelength calibration inaccuracies associated with KPF during early
operations. Long-term SoCal operations will collect upwards of 1,000 solar
spectra per six-hour day using KPF's fast readout mode, enabling stellar
activity studies at high signal-to-noise on our nearest solar-type star.",2023-11-09T03:52:44Z
"Systematic KMTNet Planetary Anomaly Search. XI. Complete Sample of 2016
  Sub-Prime Field Planets","Following Shin et al. (2023b), which is a part of the Systematic KMTNet
Planetary Anomaly Search series (i.e., a search for planets in the 2016 KMTNet
prime fields), we conduct a systematic search of the 2016 KMTNet sub-prime
fields using a semi-machine-based algorithm to identify hidden anomalous events
missed by the conventional by-eye search. We find four new planets and seven
planet candidates that were buried in the KMTNet archive. The new planets are
OGLE-2016-BLG-1598Lb, OGLE-2016-BLG-1800Lb, MOA-2016-BLG-526Lb, and
KMT-2016-BLG-2321Lb, which show typical properties of microlensing planets,
i.e., giant planets orbit M dwarf host stars beyond their snow lines. For the
planet candidates, we find planet/binary or 2L1S/1L2S degeneracies, which are
an obstacle to firmly claiming planet detections. By combining the results of
Shin et al. (2023b) and this work, we find a total of nine hidden planets,
which is about half the number of planets discovered by eye in 2016. With this
work, we have met the goal of the systematic search series for 2016, which is
to build a complete microlensing planet sample. We also show that our
systematic searches significantly contribute to completing the planet sample,
especially for planet/host mass ratios smaller than $10^{-3}$, which were
incomplete in previous by-eye searches of the KMTNet archive.",2024-01-08T22:03:29Z
"Large-Scale High-Lundquist Number Reduced MHD Simulations of the Solar
  Corona Using GPU Accelerated Machines","We have recently carried out a computational campaign to investigate a model
of coronal heating in three-dimensions using reduced magnetohydrodynamics
(RMHD). Our code is built on a conventional scheme using the pseudo-spectral
method, and is parallelized using MPI. The current investigation requires very
long time integrations using high Lundquist numbers, where the formation of
very fine current layers challenge the resolutions achievable even on massively
parallel machines. We present here results of a port to Nvidia CUDA (Compute
Unified Device Architecture) for hardware acceleration using graphics
processing units (GPUs). In addition to a brief discussion of our general
strategy, we will report code performance on several machines which span a
variety of hardware configurations and capabilities. These include a desktop
workstation with commodity hardware, a dedicated research workstation equipped
with four Nvidia C2050 GPUs, as well as several large-scale GPU accelerated
distributed memory machines: Lincoln/NCSA, Dirac/NERSC, and Keeneland/NICS.",2011-09-27T21:10:58Z
"Persistent mysteries of jet engines, formation, propagation, and
  particle acceleration: have they been addressed experimentally?","The physics of astrophysical jets can be divided into three regimes: (i)
engine and launch (ii) propagation and collimation, (iii) dissipation and
particle acceleration. Since astrophysical jets comprise a huge range of scales
and phenomena, practicality dictates that most studies of jets intentionally or
inadvertently focus on one of these regimes, and even therein, one body of work
may be simply boundary condition for another. We first discuss long standing
persistent mysteries that pertain the physics of each of these regimes,
independent of the method used to study them. This discussion makes contact
with frontiers of plasma astrophysics more generally. While observations
theory, and simulations, and have long been the main tools of the trade, what
about laboratory experiments? Jet related experiments have offered controlled
studies of specific principles, physical processes, and benchmarks for
numerical and theoretical calculations. We discuss what has been done to date
on these fronts. Although experiments have indeed helped us to understand
certain processes, proof of principle concepts, and benchmarked codes, they
have yet to solved an astrophysical jet mystery on their own. A challenge is
that experimental tools used for jet-related experiments so far, are typically
not machines originally designed for that purpose, or designed with specific
astrophysical mysteries in mind. This presents an opportunity for a different
way of thinking about the development of future platforms: start with the
astrophysical mystery and build an experiment to address it.",2020-09-17T04:28:06Z
"A Fast second-order solver for stiff multifluid dust and gas
  hydrodynamics","We present MDIRK: a Multifluid second-order Diagonally-Implicit Runge-Kutta
method to study momentum transfer between gas and an arbitrary number ($N$) of
dust species. The method integrates the equations of hydrodynamics with an
Implicit Explicit (IMEX) scheme and solves the stiff source term in the
momentum equation with a diagonally-implicit asymptotically stable Runge-Kutta
method (DIRK). In particular, DIRK admits a simple analytical solution that can
be evaluated with $\mathcal{O}(N)$ operations, instead of standard matrix
inversion, which is $\mathcal{O}(N)^3$. Therefore the analytical solution
significantly reduces the computational cost of the multifluid method, making
it suitable for studying the dynamics of systems with particle-size
distributions. We demonstrate that the method conserves momentum to machine
precision and converges to the correct equilibrium solution with constant
external acceleration. To validate our numerical method we present a series of
simple hydrodynamic tests, including damping of sound waves, dusty shocks, a
multi-fluid dusty Jeans instability, and a steady-state gas-dust drift
calculation. The simplicity of MDIRK lays the groundwork to build fast
high-order asymptotically stable multifluid methods.",2023-09-29T15:58:49Z
